The government of the People\\'s\\nRepublic of China (hereinafter referred to as \"China\") attaches great importance to addressing\\nclimate change, adheres to the principles of equity, common but differentiated responsibilities\\nand respective capabilities (CBDR–RC), firmly upholds multilateralism, and facilitates the\\njoint implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\\n(hereinafter referred to as the \"UNFCCC\") and its Paris Agreement. The Chinese\\nGovernment has submitted four National Communications (NCs) and three Biennial Update\\nReports (BURs), comprehensively reporting on China\\'s actions, progress, and achievements\\nin implementing the objectives of the UNFCCC.\\nUnder the UNFCCC, its Paris Agreement further established an Enhanced Transparency\\nFramework (ETF), requiring Parties to submit Biennial Transparency Reports (BTRs) every\\ntwo years, building upon existing work under the UNFCCC. According to Decision\\n18/CMA.1, Parties are required to submit their first Biennial Transparency Report no later\\nthan the end of 2024. As a developing country, China initiated the GEF project application\\nprocess in 2020 and began preparing the People\\'s Republic of China First Biennial\\nTransparency Report on Climate Change (hereinafter referred to as the \"1BTR\") in 2022. The\\npreparation and submission of the 1BTR has received support from GEF\\'s \"Enabling China to\\nPrepare Its Fourth National Communication, and Biennial Update Reports on Climate\\nChange\" and \"Enabling China to Prepare Its First Biennial Transparency Reports on Climate\\nChange under UNFCCC\" Capacity Building Projects, and “China Capacity Building for\\nEnhanced Transparency Phase I” Project under Capacity-Building Initiative for Transparency\\n(CBIT).\\nThis report fully complies with the requirements of the Modalities, Procedures and\\nGuidelines (MPGs) for the ETF and Common Reporting Tables under the Paris Agreement.

According to the implementation rules of the Paris\\nAgreement, starting from 2024, the National GHG Inventories submitted by Parties should be\\nprepared with reference to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas\\nInventories\\n[1](hereinafter referred to as the “2006 IPCC Guidelines”) and the 2013\\nSupplement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories: Wetlands\\n(hereinafter referred to as the \"2013 IPCC Wetlands Supplement\"), and reported using the\\n100-year time-horizon GWP values from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). The\\ninventory for the base year (2005 for China) of Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)\\nwas updated using the same methodology and data sources as those for 2020-2021. The\\ncurrent inventory was prepared in accordance with the above requirements. Activity data\\nwere mainly sourced from official statistics, and the emission factors were primarily based on\\ncountry-specific parameters.\\n\\nThe Chinese government attaches great importance to the compilation of the National GHG\\nInventory (hereinafter referred to as the \"National Inventory\"), establishing a working model\\nwhere the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE), as the national lead authority for\\nclimate change, coordinates with the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and other relevant\\ngovernment departments and industry associations, while multiple research institutions carry\\nout the specific compilation work.\\nMEE is mainly responsible for organizing and coordinating inventory-related work. Funded\\nwith international grants, MEE established a dedicated Project Management Office\\n(hereinafter referred to as \"PMO\"), which selects the responsible organizations for\\ninventories on each sector through an open bidding process. The lead and main participating\\norganizations for inventory compilation in each category is shown in Table 1-1. After the\\ncompletion of category -specific inventories, the National Center for Climate Change\\nStrategy and International Cooperation (NCSC) will take the lead in preparing and compiling\\na synthesis inventory. Following expert review and departmental consultation, this inventory\\nwill be submitted to the State Council as a key component of the report. Upon approval by\\nthe State Council, it will be submitted to the UNFCCC Secretariat.

To\\nestablish a regular data collection mechanism, China issued the Notice on Carrying Out\\nStatistical Work for Climate Change in 2013, and developed the Statistical Reporting System\\nfor Climate Change by Sectors (Trial) and the Form of Statistical Data Requirements for\\nClimate Change in the Integrated Government Statistical System. As the inventory\\ncompilation process evolves, the required underlying statistics also change. The statistical\\nreporting system for climate change was revised in 2020.\\nEmission factors were primarily obtained through special research, statistics, and test\\nanalyses conducted by the inventory team and other relevant organizations. For non-key\\ncategories, default emission factors from guidelines were used. With the steady progress of\\nthe national carbon market, there has been a gradual increase in facility-level measured data\\nfrom industries such as thermal power and improvement in data quality. Drawing from\\ninternational experience, enterprise-level data are gradually being applied to inventory\\ncompiling and related quality assurance and quality control processes.\\nChina emphasizes the management of data documentation during the inventory compilation\\nprocess, promptly preserving supporting materials. Meanwhile, inventory is electronically\\nmanaged and archived in the database system of national GHG inventories.\\nQuality control (QC) is carried out throughout the entire inventory compilation process by\\ndifferent\\nmembers\\nof\\nthe inventory\\nteam,\\ncovering\\naspects\\nsuch\\nas\\nmethodology\\ndetermination, activity data, emission factors, inventory calculation and uncertainty\\nassessment, and inventory reporting. This includes trend analysis, completeness checks, data\\nentry error and unit conversion checks, and archiving. Quality assurance (QA) includes\\nindependent analysis and review by personnel not directly involved in the inventory\\ncompilation process, providing strong support for ensuring the quality of inventory results. In\\naddition, opinions and suggestions from other domestic research institutions and experts are\\nextensively sought through technical seminars and other forms.\\nDuring the current inventory compilation process, due to limitations in underlying data\\nstatistics and other issues, the following sources/sinks were not included: CO2 transport and\\nstorage; uncontrolled combustion and burning coal dumps; other process uses of carbonates;\\nemissions from agricultural soils due to application of lime and dolomite, etc.; N2O emissions\\nfrom wetlands; and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) emissions.\\n\\n\\nAccording to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, Approach 1 level and trend assessment were used to\\nidentify key categories in the 2020-2021 inventory. The results show that there were 76 key\\ncategories in the 2020-2021 inventory, with detailed information on key categories shown in\\nTable 1-2.\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n5\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\nEnergy\\n1.A.1.a -Fuel combustion -

The difference lies in that Tier 1 uses default emission factors provided\\nby the IPCC, while Tier 2 employs country-specific emission factors.

With regard to waste treatment, CH4 and N2O emissions\\nfrom municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration and CO2 emissions from fossil sources are\\nreported under Energy. Fugitive emissions cover CH4 emissions from solid fuels, and oil and\\nnatural gas system. Due to the limited data availability, the current inventory didn\\'t report on\\nCO2 transport, injection, and geological storage. In addition, the inventory on Energy also\\nreported CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions from international bunkers and CO2 emissions from\\nbiomass in memo items.\\n\\nCO2, CH4 and N2O emissions from fossil fuel combustion were calculated by the Sectoral\\nApproach and verified with the Reference Approach. Tier 2 method was used for CO2\\nemissions from stationary combustion. Tier 2 method was used for CH4 and N2O emissions\\nfrom public electricity and heat production, and Tier 1 method was used for CH4 and N2O\\nemissions from other stationary sources. With regard to mobile combustion, Tier 2 method\\nwas used for CO2 emissions from road transportation, and COPERT model was used for CH4\\nand N2O emissions; Tier 3 method was used for GHG emissions from domestic navigation,\\nPart I National GHG Inventory\\n30\\nand Tier 1 method was used for GHG emissions from railways, domestic navigation and\\npipeline transportation. With regard to other fuels, Tier 2 method was used for CH4 emissions\\nfrom residential biomass combustion, and fossil-derived GHG emissions from MSW\\nincineration, while Tier 1 method was used for other components. Tier 2 and Tier 3 methods\\nwere used for CH4 emissions from underground mines, and Tier 1 method was used for CH4\\nemissions from surface mines. Tier 1 and Tier 3 methods were used for fugitive CH4\\nemissions from oil and natural gas system, see Table 1-3.\\n\\nIn 2021, China\\'s GHG emissions from Energy were 11,007 MtCO2eq. To be specific, CO2\\nemissions were 10,095 Mt, CH4 emissions were 28.165 Mt, and N2O emissions were 0.464\\nMt, accounting for 91.7%, 7.2%, and 1.1%, and increased by 4.5%, 0.9%, and 5.1%,\\nrespectively, over the 2020 levels, as shown in Table 1-4.\\n\\nBased on the propagation of error and Monte Carlo Simulation methods, the uncertainties of\\nthe GHG Inventory on Energy in 2005, 2020, and 2021 were from -5.1% to 5.3%, -5.4% to\\n5.7%, and -5.6% to 5.8% respectively, as detailed in Table 1-7.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.A Fuel combustion\\n-2.1~2.2\\n-2.5~2.9\\n-2.8~3.1\\n1.B Fugitive emissions\\n-26.4~26.4\\n-23.7~23.9\\n-24.0~24.1\\nOverall uncertainty\\n-5.1~5.3\\n-5.4~5.7\\n-5.6~5.8\\n\\nIn 2021, China\\'s GHG emissions from fuel combustion were 10,257 MtCO2eq, an increase of\\n4.5% compared to 2020. This was mainly due to the fact that China\\'s total energy\\nconsumption reached 5,260 Mtce, an increase of 5.5% over the previous year. To be specific,\\nin 2021, GHG emissions from the energy industries, manufacturing industries and\\nconstruction, transport, and other sectors were 5,354 MtCO2eq, 3,269 MtCO2eq, 1,002\\nMtCO2eq, and 632 MtCO2eq, respectively. GHG emissions from energy industries grew by\\n9.9% compared to 2020, mainly due to the increase in the burning of fossil fuels. GHG\\nemissions from manufacturing industries and construction decreased by 2.5% compared to\\n2020, primarily due to a slight decline in output in industries such as steel and non-metallic\\nminerals. GHG emissions from transport grew by 8.9% compared to 2020, primarily due to\\nthe recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid growth in road transportation. The\\nspecific details can be found in Table 1-4.\\n\\nGHG emissions from fuel combustion refer to CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions from\\ncombustion of different types of fuels in stationary or mobile combustion equipment. Fuel\\ncombustion sources include CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from energy industries,\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n31\\nmanufacturing industries and construction, transport, and other sectors. Energy industries can\\nbe further segmented into public electricity and heat production, petroleum refining,\\nmanufacture of solid fuels and other energy industries; manufacturing industries and\\nconstruction can be further segmented into iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, chemicals, pulp,\\npaper\\nand\\nprint,\\nfood\\nprocessing,\\nbeverages\\nand\\ntobacco,\\nnon-metallic\\nminerals,\\nmanufacturing of transport equipment, manufacturing of machinery, mining (excluding fuels)\\nand quarrying, wood and wood products, construction, textile and leather, and other\\nindustries; transport can be further segmented into domestic aviation, road transportation,\\nrailways, domestic navigation, and other transport; other sectors can be further segmented\\ninto commercial/institutional, residential, and agriculture/forestry/fishing. Of these, civil\\naviation and water-borne navigation also need to be split separately into international aviation\\nand international navigation, which are reported as memo items. According to the 2006 IPCC\\nGuidelines, non-energy products from fuels and solvent use was reported under IPPU, and\\nthe above emissions have excluded emissions from non-energy products from fuels and\\nsolvent use. CH4 and N2O emissions from biomass combustion were reported under public\\nelectricity and heat production, as well as residential; CO2 emissions from biomass were\\nreported as memo items.

The specific method is to\\ncalculate the apparent consumption (physical quantity) of various types of fuels based on the\\nproduction, import and export quantities, stock changes, and international bunkers in Energy\\nBalance of China; and estimate CO2 emissions from fuel combustion by calculating the total\\ncarbon content in fuels available for domestic consumption based on their respective net\\ncalorific values and carbon content per unit calorific value, and excluding the carbon content\\nin non-energy uses. Production, import and export quantities etc. in the reference approach\\nwere derived from official statistics such as the Energy Balance of China and net calorific\\nvalues, carbon content per unit calorific value and carbon oxidation rate of each fuel were\\nweighted according to the consumption data of the corresponding fuel types in the sectoral\\napproach.\\n\\nThe variance between the reference and sectoral approach in 2020 and 2021 was 2.5% and\\n1.2%, respectively, as detailed in Table 1-10. The variances exist for two reasons: first,\\nenergy transportation losses, coal washing and screening losses, \"balance differences\", and\\nstock changes in end-use sectors lead to discrepancies between the apparent energy\\nconsumption in the reference approach and the terminal energy consumption in the sectoral\\napproach; second, regarding emission factors, in case of oil products, the reference approach\\nmainly calculates crude oil, while the sectoral approach mainly calculates refined oil products\\nconsumed by end-use sectors, and there are certain differences in carbon content per unit\\ncalorific value between crude oil and various refined oil products.

The data on\\nrecovered volume was obtained from surveys of grid companies, while emission factors were\\nbased on the 2018 inventory.\\n\\nBased on the propagation of error method, the uncertainty in estimating emissions from SF6\\nuse in electrical equipment was from -22.4% to 22.4%.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Inventory of Agriculture covers CH4 emissions from enteric fermentation, CH4 and N2O\\nemissions from manure management, CH4 emissions from rice cultivation, N2O emissions\\nfrom agricultural soils, and CH4 and N2O emissions from field burning of agricultural\\nresidues. Enteric fermentation emissions include CH4 emissions from 12 livestock species\\nincluding beef cattle, dairy cattle, goats and sheep, etc. Manure management emissions\\ninclude CH4 emissions and direct and indirect N2O emissions from 14 livestock species such\\nas dairy cattle, beef cattle, goats, sheep, swine and poultry, etc. Rice cultivation emissions\\ninclude CH4 emissions from single cropping rice, early rice and late rice of double cropping\\nrice in rice growing season, and from winter-flooding paddy fields in non-rice growing\\nseason. N2O emissions from agricultural soils include the direct N2O emissions of 11\\ndifferent types of agricultural soils including dryland, rice paddies with different rotations,\\nvegetable fields, orchards, tea plantations, and pasture from the application of chemical\\nfertilizers, animal manure, and crop residues, and the indirect N2O emissions due to N inputs\\ncausing volatile N deposition, N leaching and runoff, as well as the direct and indirect N2O\\nemissions from mineralization of agricultural soils. The inventory didn\\'t subtract the carbon\\nPart I National GHG Inventory\\n52\\ncaptured during urea production in IPPU, so it also didn\\'t include CO2 emissions from the\\napplication of urea to agricultural soils. Moreover, due to data unavailability, the current\\ninventory didn\\'t include CO2 emissions from the application of lime and dolomite to\\nagricultural soils. Additionally, since there is no organic soil cultivation in China, its\\nemissions have not been reported.\\n\\nCH4 emissions from enteric fermentation were calculated using Tier 2 method of the 2006\\nIPCC Guidelines for major sources such as beef cattle, dairy cattle, buffalo, sheep and goats,\\nand Tier 1 method for other sources. CH4 and N2O emissions from manure management were\\ncalculated using Tier 2 method of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for major sources such as swine,\\nbeef cattle, dairy cattle, poultry, buffalo, sheep and goats, and Tier 1 method for other sources.\\nManure management emissions include both direct N2O emissions, and indirect N2O\\nemissions caused by volatile N deposition and N leaching and runoff. With regard to CH4\\nemissions from rice cultivation, the CH4MOD[3] model (Tier 3) was used for single cropping\\nrice, early rice and late rice of double cropping rice in rice growing season, and empirical\\nmodels (Tier 2) [4]were used for winter-flooding paddy fields in non-rice growing season. As\\nfor the former, the CH4MOD model calculated the CH4 emission factors of different types of\\nrice fields based on the CH4 generation, transmission, and emission mechanisms in rice\\ngrowing season, and then calculated and aggregated CH4 emissions at the prefecture/city\\nlevel based on statistical data on the area of different types of rice fields. As for the latter, the\\nCH4 emission from winter-flooding paddy fields in non-rice growing season was calculated\\nusing empirical models, equivalent to the Tier 2 method of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. N2O\\nemissions from agricultural soils were calculated using the IAP-N model[5] based on the\\nChinese crop farming system to calculate the N inputs of direct and indirect N2O emissions\\nfrom different types of agricultural soils by region, and to obtain N2O emissions derived by\\napplying the relevant emission factors. Direct and indirect N2O emissions from soils\\nmineralization and grazing animals, and CH4 and N2O emissions from field burning of\\nagricultural residues were calculated using Tier 1 method, as shown in Table 1-3.\\n\\nIn 2021, China\\'s GHG emissions from Agriculture were 931 MtCO2eq. Of which, CH4\\nemissions were 24.279 Mt, and N2O emissions were 0.949 Mt, accounting for 73.0% and\\n27.0%, and increased by 2.4% and 0.3% respectively compared to 2020, as shown in Table 1-\\n4.\\n\\nBased on the error propagation method, the uncertainties of the GHG emissions from\\n[3] Huang, Y, Zhang, W., Zheng, X.H., Li, J. and Yu, Y.Q.

Therefore, emissions from the\\nuse of energy as raw materials or materials during the production processes of products such\\nas calcium carbide, ethylene, methanol, ferroalloys, lead and zinc production, as well as\\nemissions from non-energy products from fuels and solvent use such as lubricants and\\nparaffin waxes, were reported under IPPU. At the same time, to avoid double counting of\\nconverter gas emissions, only emissions from the use of carbonate fluxes were reported for\\niron and steel production under IPPU, and CO2 emissions from converter steelmaking were\\nnot reported.\\nIn the cross-cutting categories of Energy and Agriculture, to ensure the consistency of data on\\nnumber of animals, grazing animals, and N2O emissions from manure management, animal\\nmanure data has already deducted the amount of animal manure from pasture within farming\\nregions, actual grazing animals in pastoral areas and grazing cattle manure as fuel to avoid\\ndouble counting of manure entering the agricultural soils.\\nIn the cross-cutting categories of Energy and Waste, emissions from incineration of waste as\\nenergy recovery should be reported under Energy. Therefore, CH4 and N2O emissions from\\nincineration of MSW, and fossil CO2 emissions were reported under Energy, while biogenic\\nCO2 emissions were reported as memo items. The emissions from incineration under Waste\\nonly covered CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions from hazardous and medical waste incineration,\\nand CH4 and N2O emissions from sludge incineration.\\nIn the cross-cutting categories of IPPU, Energy, and Agriculture, short-term carbon sinks\\nfrom downstream urea production and joint soda production were not excluded from\\nemissions from ammonia production under IPPU. Correspondingly, CO2 emissions from the\\nuse of urea as a catalyst in road transportation under Energy and the application of urea under\\nAgriculture were not reported.\\nIn the cross-cutting categories of Agriculture and LULUCF, the main sources of underlying\\nPart I National GHG Inventory\\n76\\ndata such as major crop statistics, agricultural residues returning rates, and the amount of\\nmanure applied to field crops are consistent.\\nIn the cross-cutting categories of Waste and LULUCF, CH4 emissions from harvested wood\\nproducts (waste wood, paper, etc.) entering the MSW system were reported under Waste,\\nwhile changes in carbon stocks of harvested wood products were reported under LULUCF.\\nIn addition to emissions from biomass fuel combustion reported under Energy, CH4 and N2O\\nemissions from field burning of agricultural residues were reported under Agriculture; CH4\\nand N2O emissions from the burning of biomass in forest land and grassland were reported\\nunder LULUCF; and emissions from the burning of biomass were not reported under Waste.\\n\\nAs the consumption of firewood has decreased significantly and is not included in official\\nstatistics, emissions from consumption of firewood are not reported under Energy since 2015.\\nDue to the lack of data on household biogas consumption, biogas plant gas production, and\\nthe number of energy-saving stoves in provinces, the calculation is based on related\\nindicators such as the number of households using biogas and the utilization rate since 2019.\\nFor solid fuels, starting from 2015, China no longer releases data on coal production of\\nunderground mines and surface mines at the provincial level. As a result, it is no longer\\npossible to obtain the national CH4 emissions from mining activities by summing up the\\nemissions of different regions. For the 2020-2021 inventory, the emissions were calculated by\\nmultiplying the underground mines coal production with the national weighted CH4 emission\\nfactor of mining activities in 2014. The proportion of raw coal production from coal\\nproduction of surface mines to all coal production in 2020 was obtained by interpolating the\\nproportions for 2019 and 2021. For the oil and natural gas system, the 2005 data was split\\nbased on the output in the current year and corresponding activity data in 2015. Additionally,\\ndue to a lack of statistics, emissions from well completions, abandoned wells, flaring, and\\nLNG imports were not reported in the updated 2005 inventory.\\nFor IPPU, due to the fact that the China Steel Statistics Yearbook no longer published the\\ncategory-specific product data of the China Iron and Steel Association (CISA) after 2016, the\\nferroalloys output in 2020-2021 was split based on the proportion of category-specific\\nproduct outputs in 2016. For electronics industry, to strengthen the inventory statistics,\\nstarting from 2014, NBS and NDRC issued the Notice on Carrying Out Statistical Work for\\nClimate Change (GTZ[2013] No. 80), developed the Statistical Reporting System for Climate\\nChange by Sectors (Trial), and conducted national-level statistical work on the production\\nand usage of HFCs, PFCs, SF6 and fluorinated gases, and new addition data for automotive\\nand room air conditioning equipment was sourced from the China Statistical Yearbook. The\\nproduction data for 2005 was derived from industry association research and linear\\ncalculations, while the production and usage for fluorinated gases in 2020-2021 was sourced\\nfrom data of the Statistical Reporting System for Climate Change.\\nFor LULUCF, from 2021 onwards, the activity data on arboreal forests and bamboo forests\\nwere based on the results of the integrated forest and grassland ecological monitoring, and the\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n77\\narea of each of the other land types was determined on the basis of the results of the Third\\nNationwide Land Survey in 2019 and its annual updated data.

For example, for\\nthe COPERT model for road transportation, the fuel balance module was used to verify the\\ntotal fuel consumption, ensuring the accuracy of CO2 emissions.\\nThird, the consistency of the data from different categories were verified. For example, the\\ndata such as the number of grazing animals, the amount of animal manure used as fuels in\\nPart I National GHG Inventory\\n78\\npastoral areas and in farming areas were verified across agricultural sub-sectors. Another\\nexample is data verification of biomass fuel in the inventories on LULUCF and Energy.\\n\\nFollowing the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, the database system of national GHG inventories for\\nactivity data, emission factors, and related parameters were established, and the relevant\\ninventory materials were archived and preserved.\\n\\nThe inventory has sought the comments and suggestions from the member units of the\\nNational Leading Group on Climate Change, Energy Conservation and Emissions Reduction,\\nas well as relevant industry associations. The inventory results were compared with the\\nrelevant calculation results published by domestic and international peer institutions.\\n\\nAccording to the implementation rules of the Paris Agreement, from 2024 onwards, the\\ninventory reports submitted by the Parties shall refer to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. With the\\ncomprehensive transformation of the 2020-2021 inventory methodology and the necessary\\nadjustments of the underlying data, the current inventory for the base year (2005) of NDC\\nwas updated, with the specific results and difference analysis detailed in Table 1-53.\\nNewly added sources include CH4 emissions from post-mining activities of surface mines,\\ndirect and indirect N2O emissions from soils mineralization, and indirect N2O emissions from\\nN volatilization and re-deposition from animal manure.\\nIn terms of calculation methods, the methodology for aviation was upgraded to Tier 3, and\\nthe methodology for the exploration was updated to further refine the distinction between oil\\nand gas wells.\\nActivity data on production processes such as lime, ammonia, methanol, ethylene, titanium\\ndioxide, aluminium, lead and zinc smelting were refined according to the availability of\\nactivity data sources. Data on animal feeding was adjusted based on revised data from the\\nThird Agricultural Census.

The crop residues returning\\nrates were also updated. For Waste, the degradable organic carbon content of wastes was\\nupdated through machine learning analysis and literature review, which improved the\\naccuracy of solid waste disposal data.\\nAs for the reporting format, in accordance with the implementing rules of the Paris\\nAgreement, Parties should use the 100-year time-horizon GWP values from IPCC AR5.\\nConsequently, the GWPs of the various GHGs were updated from those in IPCC AR2 to\\nthose in IPCC AR5.\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n79\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnergy\\n6,252\\n6,475\\n223\\nBased on the data adjustments for non-energy use under IPPU,\\nemission subtractions in the cross-cutting sectors between energy and\\nIPPU were updated.

For\\nmajor oil products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, aviation kerosene, aviation gasoline, fuel oil\\nand natural gas, we will carry out measurement and analysis of carbon content per unit\\ncalorific value. It is planned to carry out regional monitoring of GHG emissions from typical\\nfarmland, typical surveys of parameters for livestock and poultry production and management\\nunder different feeding practices, and regular updating of key category emission factors for\\ninventories on Agriculture. We will regularly conduct surveys on soil organic carbon data for\\neach land use type, construct high-precision soil organic carbon density maps, and carry out\\nstudies on localization of domestic sewage discharge factors.\\nFor the working mechanism of inventory compilation, we will foster regular inventory\\ncompilation, carry out a study on the work plan for regular inventory compilation, formulate\\na QA/QC plan, and further clarify the division of responsibilities of various departments in\\ninventory compilation. Furthermore, we will strengthen exchanges with the international\\ncommunity on inventory\\ncompilation, and enhance\\ncapacity building of inventory\\ncompilation personnel. The capacity-building needs in this regard are set out in Chapter 5 of\\nPart IV.\\nPart II Progress in Nationally Determined Contributions\\n84\\n\\n\\nOn September 22, 2020, Chinese President Xi Jinping solemnly declared at the General\\nDebate of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly: China would scale up its\\nNationally Determined Contributions (NDC) by adopting more vigorous policies and\\nmeasures. We aim to have carbon dioxide emissions peak before 2030 and strive to achieve\\ncarbon neutrality before 2060. In 2021, China proposed an updated 2030 NDC, which\\nincludes both carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, and mitigation goals of lower\\ncarbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by over 65% from the 2005 levels, to increase the\\nshare of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 25%, to increase the forest\\nstock volume by 6 billion cubic meters from the 2005 levels, and to bring China’s total\\ninstalled capacity of wind and solar power to over 1,200 GW, as well as policies and actions\\nfor climate change adaptation.\\nTo meet these NDC targets, China has issued several top-level Design Documents, such as\\nthe Outline of the 14th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development and\\nLong-Range Objectives Through the Year 2035 of the People\\'s Republic of China, Working\\nGuidance for Carbon Dioxide Peaking and Carbon Neutrality in Full and Faithful\\nImplementation of the New Development Philosophy, and Action Plan for Carbon Dioxide\\nPeaking Before 2030 which promote a comprehensive green transformation of economic and\\nsocial development. China has implemented a series of mitigation policies and actions across\\nEnergy, Industry, Construction, Transportation, Carbon Sinks, and Synergies Actions for\\nPollution-Carbon\\nReduction.\\nRelevant\\ndepartments\\nhave\\ndeveloped\\nsector-specific\\nimplementation plans and supporting policies, while provinces (autonomous regions and\\nmunicipalities directly under the central government) have formulated regional carbon\\npeaking implementation plans. This section, according to MPGs, reports on China’s national\\ncircumstances and institutional arrangements related to the NDC, descriptions and tracking\\nprogress of NDCs target, and effects of mitigation policies and measures since 2020. Progress\\non adaptation actions of NDC will be reported in Part III.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe socialist system is the fundamental system of the People’s Republic of China. The\\nleadership of the Communist Party of China is the defining feature of socialism with Chinese\\ncharacteristics. All power in the People’s Republic of China belongs to the people. The\\nNational People’s Congress (NPC) and local people’s congresses at various levels are the\\norgans through which the people exercise state power. The NPC is the highest organ of state\\npower, and its standing committee, the Standing Committee of the National People’s\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n85\\nCongress (NPCSC), NPC and NPCSC exercise the state legislative power. The NPC\\ncomprises representatives elected from provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities\\ndirectly under the central government, special administrative regions, and the armed forces,\\nserving five-year terms. Proper representation is allocated to ethnic minorities. The NPC\\nmeets annually, convened by the NPCSC, and is responsible for amending the Constitution,\\noverseeing its implementation, and enacting or amending basic laws on criminal, civil, state\\ninstitutional, and other matters. During NPC recesses, the NPCSC examines and approves\\nany necessary adjustments to the national economic and social development plans and state\\nbudget, decides on appointments for ministers, heads of commissions, the auditor general,\\nand the secretary-general as proposed by the Premier, and supervises the work of the State\\nCouncil. NPC representatives and NPCSC members are entitled, during NPC and NPCSC\\nsessions respectively, to question the State Council or its ministries and commissions in\\naccordance with legal procedures. The questioned authorities must provide responses. The\\nNPCSC decides on the ratification or abrogation of treaties and important agreements with\\nforeign countries. The NPC has specialized committees that research, review, and draft\\nrelevant proposals under the leadership of the NPC and NPCSC.\\nThe State Council, or Central People’s Government, is the executive organ of the highest\\norgan of state power and the highest state administrative organ. It operates under the\\nresponsibility of the Premier. Ministries and commissions operate under ministerial or\\ndirectorial responsibility. The State Council enacts administrative measures, formulates\\nadministrative regulations, and issues decisions and orders based on the Constitution and\\nlaws; proposes bills to the NPC or NPCSC; defines the tasks and responsibilities of each\\nministry and commission; oversees the work of ministries, commissions, and national-level\\nadministrative tasks that are not covered by ministries and commissions; oversees the\\nadministrative work of local governments at all levels nationwide not belong to ministries\\nand commissions; provides unified leadership in the work of state administrative organs at all\\nlevels throughout the country, delineates specific powers between central and provincial\\n(autonomous region or municipal) state administrative organs; prepares and implements\\nnational economic and social development plans and budgets; directs and manages economic\\nwork, urban and rural development, and ecological civilization construction; leads education,\\nscience, culture, health, sports, and family planning efforts; and oversees civil, public security,\\nand judicial administration, as well as foreign affairs and treaty agreements with other\\ncountries. The State Council is accountable to and reports on its work to the NPC, and during\\nNPC recesses, to the NPCSC.\\nPeople’s congresses and people’s governments are established at the provincial, autonomous\\nregion, municipal, county, city, district, township (ethnic township), and town levels. Local\\npeople’s congresses are local state organs of power. They ensure the adherence to and\\nenforcement\\nof\\nthe\\nConstitution,\\nlaws,\\nand\\nadministrative\\nregulations\\nwithin\\ntheir\\nadministrative regions; adopt and issue resolutions; and review and determine plans for local\\neconomic, cultural, and public service construction according to legally defined powers.\\nLocal people’s governments are the administrative organs at various local levels and exercise\\nadministrative authority to manage local economic, educational, scientific, cultural, health,\\nsports, urban and rural development, finance, civil affairs, public security, ethnic affairs,\\nPart II Progress in Nationally Determined Contributions\\n86\\njudicial administration, and family planning affairs within their regions according to legally\\ndefined powers. Local people’s governments are accountable to and report on their work to\\nthe higher-level state administrative organs. All local people’s governments in China are\\nunder the unified leadership of the State Council and comply with its directives.\\n\\nChina is a populous country, with a total population of [3]1.412 billion at the end of 2022,\\nincluding an urban permanent population of 921 million (accounts for 65.2% of the total\\npopulation) and a rural population of 491 million. To prevent and address the challenges of an\\naging population, China implemented a policy allowing couples with one child to have a\\nsecond child in 2013, followed by a universal two-child policy in 2016. The natural\\npopulation growth rate was -0.6‰ in 2022 (Figure 2-1)[4].\\n\\nWith improvements in living standards, health, and public health conditions, average life\\nexpectancy in China rose from 77.9 years in 2020 to 78.2 years in 2021[5].

China’s wind energy resources are abundant, with the\\nsoutheastern coast and its islands from the Yangtze River to Nan’ao Island, Northeast China,\\nInner Mongolia, and eastern Xinjiang as resource-rich regions. The southeastern coast is\\nChina’s largest wind energy resource area. China is relatively rich in total abundant solar\\nradiation resources, with a pattern of “higher in plateaus than plains, and more in dry western\\nthan humid eastern regions.” The most solar-rich areas include most of Tibet, central Qinghai,\\nand parts of northern Qinghai.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\nCoal\\nbillion tons\\n207.012\\n2\\nOil\\nbillion tons\\n3.806\\n3\\nNatural gas\\nbillion cubic meters\\n6,569.012\\n4\\nCoalbed Methane\\nbillion cubic meters\\n365.969\\n5\\nShale Gas\\nbillion cubic meters\\n560.559\\n2. Agriculture\\nChina’s climate is diverse, fostering a rich variety of crops and flora and fauna. The country’s\\nhigh summer temperatures offer favorable heat conditions, allowing certain heat-intensive\\ncrops to grow at latitudes higher than in other countries worldwide. Wheat production is\\nconcentrated in the North China Plain and Northeast Plain; rice is predominantly grown south\\nof the Qinling Mountains-Huaihe River line; and corn is widely distributed, primarily in the\\nnortheast, north, and southwest, forming an extended cultivation belt from northeast to\\nsouthwest, with the largest areas in Shandong, Jilin, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Henan,\\nand Sichuan. Rapeseed is mainly in the Yangtze River Basin, though recently shifting north;\\npeanuts are mostly in the sandy and hilly areas of eastern China in warm-temperate,\\nsubtropical, and tropical zones; and soybeans have two main cultivation areas with high\\noutput—the spring-sown soybean in the Northeast and the summer-sown soybean in the\\nHuang-Huai-Hai region. China’s prominent monsoon climate provides favorable conditions\\nfor agriculture while also presenting challenges. Concentrated rainfall brought by monsoons\\nfrom May to September often causes floods, which can adversely impact agriculture.\\n3. Forestry\\nChina’s vegetation types are diverse and distributed in a complex pattern.

In\\nthe northwestern and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau regions, vegetation includes dry grasslands,\\nsemi-desert shrub grasslands, dry desert grasslands, alpine desert, and alpine meadow shrub\\ngrasslands[9]. The Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains and the Changbai Mountain area in\\nNortheast China are the country’s largest natural forest areas. The Hengduan Mountains in\\nthe Southwest form China’s second largest natural forest region. The mountains in the\\nsoutheastern provinces, such as Fujian and Jiangxi, are mainly covered by artificial and\\nsecondary forests.\\n\\nIn 2022, China’s GDP reached RMB 121 trillion, with an optimized industrial structure\\nshifting from 11.6:47.0:41.3 in 2005 to 7.3:39.3:53.4 in 2022 (Table 2-2). Per capita GDP was\\nRMB 85,698 and per capita disposable income reached RMB 36,883.

Energy Industry\\nChina’s energy consumption in 2022 was 5.41 billion tons of standard coal. Compared to\\n2005, the share of coal consumption in total energy consumption decreased by 16.4\\npercentage points. China has consistently ranked first in the world for both the annual newly\\nadded and cumulative installed capacity of hydropower, wind power, and solar power\\ngeneration for many years. Renewable energy is playing an increasingly significant role in\\nensuring energy supply. China’s wind and solar equipment manufacturing has established a\\ncomplete industrial chain, with technologies and manufacturing scales leading globally.\\nChinese-manufactured photovoltaic components, wind turbines, gearboxes, and other key\\nparts account for 70% of the global market, contributing significantly to global carbon\\nreduction efforts.\\n3. Manufacturing and Construction\\nThe added industrial value of the Chinese manufacturing sector accounts for about 30% of\\nthe global total, with complete industrial categories covering 41 major, 207 medium, and 666\\nminor industries, China boasts all industrial sectors categorized by the United Nations, having\\nover 70,000 Specialized and Sophisticated SMEs (Small- and medium-sized enterprises).\\nThe value added by the construction industry has consistently accounted for around 7% of\\nGDP. Green buildings have rapidly developed, and building energy efficiency improvements\\nare progressing steadily. China continues to advance major infrastructure projects, enhancing\\nessential infrastructure for public welfare, and has made new breakthroughs in building new\\ninfrastructure. The capacity for housing construction has improved significantly, with a\\nsteady increase in per capita residential space.\\n4. Transportation\\nChina has established a comprehensive transport network dominated by highways, railways,\\nair, and water transport. By 2022, the total mileage of China’s transport network exceeded 6\\nmillion km, with railway mileage of 155,000 km, highway mileage of 5.35 million km, and\\ntotal commercial passenger transport and commercial freight transport of 5.59 billion\\npassenger trips and 50.66 billion tons. Port throughput reached 15.68 billion metric tons, and\\ncontainer throughput was 296 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units). Additionally, the\\ndaily average order volumes for ride-hailing services and shared bicycles were over 20\\nmillion and 33 million, respectively.\\n5. Services Sector\\nIn 2022, the added value of tertiary industries (including transportation, warehousing, and\\npostal services) reached RMB 64.2727 trillion, with the contribution rate to GDP rising from\\n44.3% in 2005 to 55.3% in 2022. The share of the financial sector in the tertiary industry has\\nnotably increased (Table 2-3).\\nPart II Progress in Nationally Determined Contributions\\n90\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWholesale and retail trade\\n18.0\\n19.7\\n19.4\\n18.1\\nTransportation, warehousing and postal services\\n13.8\\n10.3\\n8.7\\n7.9\\nAccommodation and catering industry\\n5.4\\n4.2\\n3.5\\n2.8\\nFinancial industry\\n9.7\\n14.1\\n16.1\\n14.5\\nReal Estate business\\n11.0\\n12.8\\n12.2\\n11.5\\nOther sectors\\n41.0\\n37.7\\n39.1\\n44.2\\nNote: Due to rounding, the aggregation of various items may be slightly different from the total.\\n\\nChina, as a developing country with a population of over 1.4 billion, faces a series of\\nchallenging tasks, including economic development, improving people’s livelihoods,\\npollution control, and ecological protection. In terms of energy structure, fossil fuels still\\naccount for a relatively high proportion, around the global average. An energy structure\\ndominated by coal is difficult to fundamentally change in the short term. From the\\nperspective of industrial structure, China’s industrial composition remains energy-intensive\\nand carbon-intensive, and such industries still occupy a certain proportion in the national\\neconomy. The transformation of the industrial structure has reached a critical stage, making\\nfurther upgrades increasingly challenging. These factors contribute to China’s high total\\ngreenhouse gas emissions, and it’s carbon intensity above the global average.\\nChina overcame its own economic and social challenges and, with the greatest determination,\\nintensified its efforts to address climate change. It has overachieved the target set for 2020 to\\nreduce carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 40%–45% compared to 2005 levels, as\\npledged to the international community. China has promoted a comprehensive green\\ntransformation of economic and social development, implementing various policies and\\nactions to mitigate climate change across energy, industry, construction, transportation,\\ncarbon sinks, and synergies of pollution-carbon reduction. Exports of the “New Three”\\n(electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, and solar cells) have exceeded one trillion RMB,\\nproviding high-quality clean energy products and services, thus contributing “China’s power”\\nto global climate change mitigation and low-carbon transformation. China’s climate action\\ncommitment is steadfast and impactful. China’s government structure and institutional\\nmechanisms enable efficient mobilization across departments, regions, and society through\\ntop-level planning. Currently, China’s per capita energy consumption and per capita\\nhousehold electricity consumption remain below the overall level of OECD countries (in\\n2022, these figures were approximately 25% lower than the OECD average). Over the\\ncoming period, energy demand will continue to grow, and carbon emissions may also\\nincrease for a certain period. However, the Chinese government will implement a series of\\npolicy actions and measures to ensure the achievement of its carbon peaking and carbon\\nneutrality targets.\\n\\n\\nIn 2007, the State Council of China established the National Leading Group on Climate\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n91\\nChange, Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction as the central coordinating body for\\naddressing\\nclimate change. Its main responsibilities include formulating major national\\nstrategies, policies, and countermeasures for addressing climate change, organizing climate\\nresponse efforts, reviewing international cooperation and negotiation plans, and coordinating\\nkey climate response issues. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC)\\nwas responsible for the specific climate response work.\\nIn 2008, to strengthen climate response organizational structure, the NDRC established a\\nDepartment of Climate Change. In 2012, the National Center for Climate Change Strategy\\nand International Cooperation (NCSC) was established. In 2018, following the Plan on\\nDeepening Reform of Party and State Institutions, the responsibilities for climate change\\nresponse were transferred from the NDRC to the newly formed Ministry of Ecology and\\nEnvironment (MEE), and the Department of Climate Change and NCSC were transferred to\\nthe MEE. In 2019, the member units and personnel of the National Leading Group on\\nClimate Change, Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction were adjusted. The MEE and\\nNDRC took the lead on relevant responsibilities. (Figure 2-2) The MEE leads climate change\\nresponse and emission reduction efforts, while the NDRC is responsible for coordinating\\ncarbon peaking and carbon neutrality, and overseeing energy conservation.\\nThe MEE leads the formulation of the NDC, which is submitted to the National Leading\\nGroup on Climate Change, Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction for approval, based\\non extensive studies and public consultations. Each department implements responsibilities\\naccording to its respective mandates. The NDRC, the National Energy Administration, and\\nothers are responsible for promoting low-carbon energy transformation, enhancing clean and\\nefficient coal utilization, and developing non-fossil fuels. The NDRC, Ministry of Industry\\nand Information Technology, and other relevant agencies lead efforts to reduce energy\\nconsumption and carbon emissions in industries such as steel, non-ferrous metals,\\npetrochemicals, chemicals, and non-metallic mineral products. The Ministry of Transport\\n(MOT), Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development (MOHURD), and other relevant\\nagencies lead energy conservation in transportation and construction. The Ministry of Science\\nand\\nTechnology\\n(MOST)\\nspearheads\\ngreen\\nand\\nlow-carbon\\ntechnology\\nresearch,\\ndevelopment, and application. The Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR), the MEE, and\\nother relevant agencies lead efforts to enhance carbon sink capacity in ecosystems. The\\nPeople’s Bank of China (PBC) leads efforts for establishing a green finance system,\\npromoting the adoption of green and low-carbon lifestyles and production models.\\nChina’s NDC targets are mainly calculated and monitored through its National Inventory and\\nrelevant statistical data. Since the initial National Communication on Climate Change, the\\nChinese government has built a preliminary transparency framework, forming a relatively\\nstable reporting team and a regular system for preparing the National Inventory. According to\\nthe division of responsibilities for climate change response, MEE leads the compliance of\\nNational Reports and relevant government departments provide fundamental data and\\ninformation. MEE also coordinates with related industry associations and representative\\nenterprises to gather relevant information, establishes a National Inventory database to\\nsupport inventory compilation and data management, continuously tracks the progress of\\nPart II Progress in Nationally Determined Contributions\\n92\\nChina’s NDC targets.\\nIn 2022, China formulated the Implementation Plan for Accelerating the Establishment of a\\nUnified and Standardized Carbon Emission Statistical Accounting System, outlining major\\ntasks such as establishing national and regional carbon emission statistics and accounting\\nsystems, improving carbon emission accounting mechanisms for industries and enterprises,\\nenhancing accounting methods for key products, and improving mechanisms for compiling\\nthe National Inventory. This provides solid support for improving transparency and\\ncompliance capacity.\\n\\n\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n93\\n\\n\\nIn June 2015, China submitted its Enhanced Actions on Climate Change: China’s Intended\\nNationally Determined Contributions which set forth its NDC targets for 2030. These include\\nto achieve the peaking of carbon dioxide emission around 2030 and making best efforts to\\npeak early; to lower carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 60%–65% from the 2005\\nlevels; to increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 20%;\\nto increase the forest stock volume by around 4.5 billion cubic meters on the 2005 levels; and\\nestablishing mechanisms and capacities to effectively cope with climate change risks as part\\nof adaptation goals. Fifteen policies and measures were also outlined to enhance climate\\naction. Since proposing the NDC in 2015, China has actively and pragmatically fulfilled its\\ncommitments, achieving significant progress. On September 22, 2020, Chinese President Xi\\nJinping announced to the international community on the General Debate of the 75th Session\\nof the United Nations General Assembly that, “China will scale up its intended Nationally\\nDetermined Contributions by adopting more vigorous policies and measures. We aim to have\\ncarbon dioxide emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060.”\\nIn October 2021, China officially submitted China’s Achievements, New Goals and New\\nMeasures for Nationally Determined Contributions to the UNFCCC Secretariat, updating\\nChina’s NDC targets.

The Guiding Opinions on Scientific Greening and the Several\\nOpinions on Strengthening the Protection and Restoration of Grasslands were issued to guide\\nlocal governments to carry out ecological protection and restoration in a scientific manner,\\neffectively improving the quality and stability of ecosystems. The National Wetland\\nProtection Plan (2022-2030) was published, which includes peatland wetlands and mangrove\\nforests within the planning scope. Research on forestry and grassland for carbon neutrality\\nhas been carried out.\\n We have\\ncontinuously expanded green cover while increasing carbon sinks. Between 2020 and 2022,\\nwe completed over 14.2 million hectares of afforestation and greening, improved 9.1107\\nmillion hectares of grasslands by planting grass, and reclaimed 5.3833 million hectares of\\ndesertified and rocky land. We have implemented a system where all afforestation and\\ngreening tasks are reported with location data, and assigned with map-based markers. This\\nwould ensure that afforestation, grassland improvement, and desertification control projects\\ncan be tracked on the map. The State Council has established a coordinated mechanism to\\nPart II Progress in Nationally Determined Contributions\\n106\\nstrengthen comprehensive prevention and control of desertification and advance the\\nconstruction of key ecological projects such as the \"Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Program\",\\nhelping enhance the carbon sink capacity of desert ecosystems.\\n\\n A pilot program for sustainable forest management was launched in 2020. The\\nlist of pilot cities (counties) and state-owned forest farms for forest carbon sequestration was\\nreleased in 2022. Work has been done to encourage pilot innovations and explorations, with\\nthe core objective of enhancing forestry carbon sequestration capacity. Combine local\\nrealities, we have developed innovative forest carbon enhancement techniques, effectively\\nimproved carbon sinks accounting and reporting capabilities, and explored mechanisms and\\npathways for realizing the value of forestry carbon sinks. The Guidelines for Validation and\\nCertification of Forestry Carbon Sequestration Projects was issued to consolidate the carbon\\nsequestration function of ecosystems, enhance the carbon sequestration capacity of\\necosystems, and strengthen the basic support for ecosystem carbon sequestration.\\n\\n Sustained support has been\\nprovided to relevant provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) in carrying out grassland\\necosystem restoration and management through the grassland ecosystem restoration projects.\\nFrom 2021 to 2022, a total of RMB 12.395 billion in central funds were invested to support\\nthe relevant provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) in carrying out 6.28 million\\nhectares of grassland improvement and ecological restoration. This has effectively restored\\nthe grassland vegetation and enhanced the grassland\\'s carbon sequestration capacity. From\\n2020 to 2022, 19 projects were included in the first and second batches of central government\\nfinancial support for the 14th Five-Year Plan period, with central government subsidies of\\nRMB 2 billion allocated to each project, and RMB 29.4 billion disbursed. These projects are\\nall located within the \"Three Zones and Four Belts\"[12]-based national ecological security\\nbarrier system. The implementation of these projects has played a positive role in enhancing\\nthe stability, diversity, sustainability, and carbon sequestration capacity of ecosystems in key\\necological regions such as the Yellow River basin and the Yangtze River basin. In 2020, the\\nSpecial Action Plan for Mangrove Protection and Restoration (2020-2025) was released,\\nwhich outlines the tasks for mangrove protection and restoration, and sets the goals for\\nmangrove planting and restoration by 2025. Starting in 2021, pilot carbon stock surveys and\\ncarbon sinks monitoring have been carried out for key areas with ecosystems like mangrove\\nforests.\\n\\n China has implemented a comprehensive forest chief system, built a nature\\nreserve system mainly based on national parks, and established an integrated forest and\\ngrassland fire prevention and control system.

By 2025, the utilization\\nof coal mine gas will reach 6 billion cubic meters\". In October 2021, China submitted the\\nChina’s\\nAchievements,\\nNew\\nGoals\\nand\\nNew\\nMeasures\\nfor\\nNationally\\nDetermined\\nContributions, which for the first time clearly outlines the direction for controlling methane\\nemissions in the energy sector: \"We\\'ll effectively control methane emissions from coal and\\noil/gas extraction by smartly managing coal production capacity, boosting methane drainage\\nand utilization, controlling VOCs emissions from the petrochemical industry, encouraging\\ngreen completion techniques, and promoting associated gas recovery.\"\\nPart II Progress in Nationally Determined Contributions\\n108\\nIn November 2023, the Methane Emissions Control Action Plan was released. As China\\'s first\\ncomprehensive and specialized policy document on methane emission control, the Action\\nPlan defines the methane emission control targets for key areas during the 14th Five-Year\\nPlan and 15th Five-Year Plan periods, as well as 8 key tasks for methane emissions control,\\nincluding strengthening the construction of a methane emissions monitoring, accounting,\\nreporting and verification system, promoting methane emissions control in energy and\\nagriculture, strengthening methane emission control in waste and wastewater treatment,\\nenhancing the coordinated control of pollutants and methane, fostering technological\\ninnovation and methane emission control supervision, accelerating the building of a legal and\\nregulatory policy system, and strengthening global methane governance and cooperation.\\n We have vigorously promoted the drainage and utilization of coal mine\\ngas, deployed coal mine gas prevention and control tasks on an annual basis, facilitated the\\nimplementation of support policies for gas drainage and utilization, increased central budget\\ninvestment and funding, and bolstered basic research, technical consulting, engineering\\nservices, and standards system. In June 2020, the Interim Measures for the Management of\\nSpecial Funds for the Development of Clean Energy was issued. Through the central general\\npublic budget arrangement, special funds were used to provide subsidies for the extraction\\nand utilization of unconventional natural gas such as coalbed methane (coal mine gas), based\\non the principle of \"more subsidies for more production\". In November 2020, the Notice on\\nFurther Strengthening the Environmental Impact Assessment Management of Coal Resource\\nDevelopment was issued, stipulating that \"methane with a volumetric concentration of 8% or\\nmore should be comprehensively utilized, provided that safety is ensured. We encourage\\nexploring comprehensive utilization of methane drainage with a concentration between 2%\\n(inclusive) and 8%, as well as ventilation air methane.\" The revision of the Emission\\nStandard of Coalbed Methane/Coal Mine Gas was carried out.\\n Oil and gas companies have been encouraged to control methane\\nemissions. In May 2021, state-owned enterprises such as CNPC launched the \"China Oil and\\nGas Methane Emissions Reduction Alliance\". Major oil and gas companies\\nhave\\nsubsequently announced their carbon peaking and carbon neutrality targets, as well as\\nmethane emissions reduction action plans. They have explored methane emission control\\nacross the entire oil and gas industry chain, and have committed to reducing the average\\nmethane emission intensity in natural gas production processes of member companies to\\nbelow 0.25% by 2025, approaching world-leading levels, and striving to reach world-class\\nlevels by 2035. Between 2020 and 2022, China completed four rounds of monitoring for oil\\nfield station leaks, covering a total of 19 stations and more than 680,000 monitoring points.\\n The Kigali Amendment officially came into effect for China on\\nSeptember 15, 2021 (temporarily not applicable to Hong Kong Special Administrative\\nRegion). In September 2021, the List of Controlled Ozone Depleting Substances in China was\\nreleased, which includes HFCs. In October 2021, the List of Controlled Imports and Exports\\nof Ozone Depleting Substances in China was released, and a licensing system for the import\\nand export of the listed HFCs was implemented starting from November 1. In accordance\\nwith relevant requirements, China has strengthened the management and control of HFCs\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n109\\nemissions, strictly controlled certain HFCs chemical production projects, and strengthened\\nthe environmental management of related projects. Enterprises are not allowed to directly\\ndischarge HFC-23 as a by-product. In 2020, the treatment rate of HFC-23 reached 95.5%,\\nreducing HFC-23 emissions by 828 MtCO2eq. Moreover, China has gradually phased out the\\nuse of SF6 in the power grid, and promoted energy-efficient power facilities with low GWP.\\n The Law of the People\\'s Republic of China on the Promotion of\\nRevitalization of Rural Areas and the Law of the People\\'s Republic of China on the Protection\\nof Black Soil were promulgated, providing legal framework for emissions reduction and\\ncarbon sequestration in agriculture and rural areas. In November 2021, the Ten Technical\\nModels for Emissions Reduction and Carbon Sequestration in Agriculture and Rural Areas\\nwas released, covering CH4 emission reduction technologies for rice fields, enteric\\nfermentation in ruminants, livestock and poultry manure management, as well as rural biogas\\ncomprehensive utilization. In January 2022, the Guiding Opinions on Promoting the\\nConstruction of Ecological Farms was released, which stipulates that we should explore\\npolicies for low-carbon compensation targeting ecological farms, with a focus on reducing\\nCH4 emissions from rice fields, N2O emissions from agricultural land, CH4 emissions from\\nenteric fermentation, and CH4 and N2O emissions from manure management. The\\nImplementation Plan for Emissions Reduction and Carbon Sequestration in Agriculture and\\nRural Areas issued in May 2022 has laid out key tasks in three areas - crop farming, animal\\nhusbandry, and fisheries. These tasks include reducing methane emissions from rice paddies,\\nlowering the intensity of enteric methane emissions from ruminants, and decreasing CH4 and\\nN2O emissions from livestock manure management. It has also prioritized reducing CH4\\nemissions from rice fields as one of the ten major actions to promote emissions reduction and\\ncarbon sequestration in agriculture and rural areas. China has developed a new rice\\ncultivation model that incorporates straw return to the field, boosting productivity while\\nsignificantly reducing CH4 emissions; promoted the cultivation of water-saving and drought-\\nresistant rice varieties, with annual planting areas exceeding 200,000 hectares in Anhui,\\nHubei, Zhejiang, and Hainan; and implemented actions to reduce fertilizer usage and improve\\nefficiency, thereby lowering N2O emissions from farmlands.\\n In January 2021, the Guiding Opinions on Coordinating and\\nStrengthening Work Related to Addressing Climate Change and Eco-Environment Protection\\nwas issued, which calls for strengthening the environmental management of centralized\\ntreatment facilities for sewage and waste, and coordinating the control of GHGs such as CH4\\nand N2O.

Pilot programs have been\\nfirstly carried out in key industries such as power, steel, non-metallic mineral products, non-\\nferrous metals, petrochemicals, and chemicals in Hebei, Jilin, Zhejiang, Shandong,\\nGuangdong, Chongqing, and Shaanxi. Pilot programs for carbon monitoring and assessment,\\nalong with pilot programs for collaborative control of pollution-carbon reduction based on the\\n\"Three Lines and One List\" approach, have been proceeding smoothly. September the Pilot\\nProgram for Carbon Monitoring and Assessment was issued. Building on existing\\nenvironmental monitoring work and experience, the pilot program has explored to develop\\nhigh-quality technical methods and operational models for carbon monitoring and assessment\\nwith focus on key industries, cities, and regions. October saw the release of the Notice on\\nPiloting Carbon Emission Evaluation in Industrial Park Planning and Environmental Impact\\nAssessments. The pilot program has explored technical methods and approaches for\\nincorporating carbon emission evaluations into industrial park planning and environmental\\nimpact assessments by prioritizing national and provincial industrial parks involved in key\\ncarbon-emitting industries or already undergoing planning and environmental impact\\nassessments with a foundation in carbon emission evaluation.\\nIn November 2021, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council issued Opinions on\\nDeepening the Fight Against Pollution, calling for Synergies of Pollution-Carbon Reduction,\\nand outlining seven measures to advance the carbon peaking action. A strategic roadmap to\\ntackle key elements will be designed with focus on carbon reduction. During the 14th Five-\\nYear Plan period, we will strictly control the growth of coal consumption. The coal\\nconsumption in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and its surrounding areas will decrease by\\naround 10%, the Yangtze River Delta region by around 5%, and the Fenwei Plain will see\\nnegative growth in coal consumption. In principle, the addition of new self-provided coal-\\nfired units will no longer be permitted. Support will be provided for the implementation of\\nclean energy alternatives for existing self-provided coal-fired units, and there will be\\nencouragement for self-provided power plants to transition into public power plants. We\\'ll\\npush for a simultaneous increase in natural gas use and decrease in coal use, prioritizing\\nnatural gas for households and clean heating. We\\'ll boost the share of electricity in overall\\nenergy consumption. We aim to basically eliminate scattered coal use in key plain areas. We\\'ll\\nsteadily expand the pilot program for clean heating to more cities and steadily improve clean\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n111\\nheating in northern regions.\\nIn June 2022, the Implementation Plan for Synergies of Pollution-Carbon Reduction was\\nissued, promoting the synergies of pollution-carbon reduction through integrated planning,\\ndeployment, implementation, and assessment. The guiding principles are capturing synergy\\nand efficiency gains, strengthening source control, optimizing technical approaches, fostering\\ninnovative mechanisms, and encouraging pilot programs. The goals are \"by 2025, establish a\\nbasic framework for synergies of pollution-carbon reduction, achieve significant progress in\\nstructural optimization and green & low-carbon development in key regions and sectors,\\ndevelop a number of replicable best practices, and effectively improve the synergy between\\npollution control and carbon reduction; and by 2030, significantly enhance the synergy\\ncapacity of pollution-carbon reduction, contributing to the carbon peaking target, and achieve\\nsignificant progress in collaborative efforts of carbon peaking and air quality improvement in\\nkey regions for air pollution control\". By 2030, the sales volume of new energy vehicles in\\nthe key regions for air pollution control will account for around 50% of the total new vehicle\\nsales.\\n\\nIn 2021, the national carbon emissions trading market (mandatory carbon market) was\\nofficially launched online. In 2024, the national GHG voluntary emissions reduction trading\\nmarket (voluntary carbon market) was launched. The mandatory and voluntary markets have\\ntheir respective focuses, operate independently, yet complement and interconnect with each\\nother, collectively forming China\\'s carbon market system. This has achieved a \"dual-wheel\\ndrive\" of using market mechanisms to control and reduce GHG emissions, gradually shaping\\nChina\\'s carbon pricing mechanism centered on the national carbon market, and effectively\\npromoting the green and low-carbon development of China\\'s economy and society. The\\nnational carbon emissions trading market has successfully completed two compliance cycles,\\ncovering an annual CO2 emissions of about 5.1 billion tons, and including 2257 key emitters,\\nmaking it the world\\'s largest carbon market in terms of GHG emissions coverage. By the end\\nof 2023, China\\'s national carbon emissions trading market had an accumulative trading\\nvolume of 440 million tons, with a turnover of about RMB 24.9 billion. The market ran\\nsmoothly overall, the price discovery mechanism showed initial effectiveness, and companies\\nshowed significantly improved awareness and capability to reduce emissions, basically\\nachieving the expected goals.\\n The State Council has\\nissued the Interim Regulations on the Management of Carbon Emissions Trading, and the\\nMEE has introduced management measures and rules on carbon emissions registration,\\ntrading, and settlement, as well as technical specifications and supervisory requirements for\\ncarbon emissions accounting, reporting and verification of the power generation industry. The\\nrequirements and regulations for key steps such as registration, emissions monitoring,\\naccounting, reporting, verification, quota allocation, quota trading, and quota settlement have\\nbeen clearly defined, initially forming a legal system and working mechanism for national\\ncarbon emissions trading market composed of administrative regulations, departmental rules,\\nand operating rules for trading and registration organizations.\\nPart II Progress in Nationally Determined Contributions\\n112\\n\\n We have built the \"National Carbon Market Information Network\" to\\ncentrally release authoritative information and news on the national carbon market; set up the\\nnational carbon emission rights registration and trading institutions to meticulously manage\\nquota registration, allocation, settlement, and trading. The national carbon emission\\nallowance registration system, trading system, and management platform—the 3 major\\ninfrastructure components—have been established and are operating stably. This has achieved\\nonline processing for all business management stages, centralized data management\\nthroughout the entire process, and scientifically-based integrated decision-making. As a result,\\nthe foundational support system for the national carbon emission allowance market is now\\nbasically in place.\\n We\\nhave established a normalized and long-term regulatory mechanism for carbon emissions data\\nquality, implemented \"national-provincial-municipal\" three-level joint reviews, and fully\\nutilized information technologies such as big data and blockchain for intelligent early\\nwarning, eliminating data issues in the \"germination\" stage. We have developed a dynamic\\ncompliance risk monitoring mechanism to urge enterprises to complete quota settlements on\\ntime and in full. All enterprises have set up internal control systems for carbon emission\\nmanagement, and incorporated carbon asset management into their daily operations,\\nsignificantly improving their management level and accounting capabilities.\\n China has\\nbeen actively promoting the launch of the national voluntary GHG emissions reduction\\ntrading market, and has issued the Measures for the Management of GHG Voluntary\\nEmissions Reduction Trading (Trial), supporting social entities to voluntarily develop GHG\\nemissions reduction projects.

The Chinese government considers proactive climate change adaptation\\na critical component of the national strategy to address climate change. It actively implements\\npolicies and actions, as set out in China’s Achievements, New Goals and New Measures for\\nNationally Determined Contributions, achieving significant results in priority areas for\\nclimate change adaptation. China also actively engages in international cooperation on\\nclimate change adaptation and related joint research, promoting mutual learning and\\nknowledge sharing. These efforts have effectively enhanced the capacity of China and other\\ndeveloping countries to adapt to climate change, raising awareness among decision-makers\\nand the public alike. However, China faces numerous challenges in advancing adaptation\\nactions, such as weak climate change monitoring, early warning, and risk management\\ncapabilities, insufficient adaptability in natural ecosystems, and limited adaptive capacity\\nwithin economic and social systems.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChina features diverse terrain, including five basic landforms: plateaus, hills, mountains,\\nbasins, and plains. Approximately 67% of China’s land area is composed of mountains,\\nplateaus, and hills, while 33% is covered by basins and plains. The topography generally\\ndecreases in elevation from west to east, forming a three-step layout. The first step is the\\nQinghai-Tibet Plateau, with an average elevation of over 4,000 meters, serving as an essential\\necological security shield, a strategic resource reserve, and a biodiversity repository of high-\\naltitude species. It nurtures ten significant rivers, including the Yellow River, Yangtze River,\\nand Lancang-Mekong River, and slopes from northwest to southeast. The second step,\\naveraging 1,000 to 2,000 meters in elevation, includes large basins and plateaus such as the\\nInner Mongolia Plateau, Loess Plateau, Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, Tarim Basin, Junggar Basin,\\nand Sichuan Basin. The third step, primarily composed of vast plains interspersed with hills\\nand low mountains, has an elevation mostly below 500 meters. This step includes the\\nLiaodong Hills, Shandong Hills, Jiangnan Hills, and extensive plains such as the Northeast\\nPlain, North China Plain, Middle and Lower Yangtze Plain, and Pearl River Delta Plain.\\nChina’s eastern lands host inland seas like the Bohai Sea and marginal seas such as the\\nYellow Sea, East China Sea, and South China Sea, with seawater depth increasing\\nprogressively from north to south. The long coastline has a wide continental shelf (Figure 3-1).\\nPart III Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation\\n128\\n\\n\\nChina has a complex climate, with monsoon climates in the east, temperate continental\\nclimates in the northwest, and alpine climates on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Most of China\\nlies in the northern temperate zone, with a significant latitude difference of 50° from north to\\nsouth. This results in marked differences in solar height and temperature between northern\\nand southern regions. China’s climate is characterized by hot, rainy summers; cold, dry\\nwinters; and simultaneous periods of high temperature and heavy rainfall. Annual\\nprecipitation decreases from the southeast coast toward the northwest inland. See Chapter II\\nof this part for the change trend of annual average temperature and precipitation data.\\nChina frequently experiences extreme weather and climate events, with droughts, floods, cold\\nwaves, and typhoons being the primary impactful hazards. Marine disasters mainly include\\nstorm surges, sea waves, and red tides. Droughts are prevalent in the north, while both\\ndroughts and floods occur in the south. Southeastern coastal regions are often struck by\\ntropical storms from June to September, while cold air from Mongolia and Siberia triggers\\ncold waves in autumn and winter, leading to low temperatures, strong winds, sandstorms, and\\nfrost. In recent years, climate disasters have shown spatial and temporal unevenness, with\\nmost incidents occurring in the summer and autumn, heavily impacting central and western\\nareas. Flood disasters are most severe in the north and south but less so in central regions.\\nConsecutive summer and autumn droughts have occurred in the Yangtze River basin, while\\nlow temperatures, rain, snow, and ice have significantly impacted the southwest and south-\\ncentral regions, with severe snow disasters in Xinjiang, and severe storm surges affecting\\nShandong and Guangdong.\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n129\\n\\n\\nChina’s land resources are diverse, featuring extensive distributions of farmland, forest land,\\ngrasslands, deserts, and tidal flats, but limited arable land per capita. The Northeast Plain,\\nNorth China Plain, Middle and Lower Yangtze Plain, Pearl River Delta Plain, and Sichuan\\nBasin are key farmland areas. Grasslands are mainly in the north and west, while forests are\\nconcentrated in the northeast, southwest, and south. Detailed land use data can be found in\\nChapter 6 of Part I.\\n\\nChina is one of the world’s richest countries in terms of rivers and lakes, with 2,221 rivers\\ncovering an area of over 1,000 square kilometers each, and over 2,800 natural lakes larger\\nthan 1 square kilometer. China’s water resources are unevenly distributed, with higher\\navailability in summer and autumn and significant annual variations. Spatially, eastern and\\nsouthern regions have more water than western and northern areas. China’s per capita water\\nresource is only one-fourth of the world average.

Temperature\\nAccording to model simulations from the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison\\nProject (CMIP6), China’s average annual temperature is expected to continue rising.\\nCompared to 1995–2014, under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) 1-2.6 and SSP5-\\nYear\\nPart III Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation\\n134\\n8.5 scenarios, annual average temperatures are projected to increase by 1.6°C (0.9°C–2.2°C)\\nand 5.3°C (3.5°C–7.1°C), respectively, by the end of the 21st century. Temperature increases\\nare expected to be more pronounced in the northeast, northwest, and Tibetan Plateau regions.\\n2. Precipitation\\nResults from the sixth phase of the global climate model comparison project indicate that\\naverage annual precipitation in China is generally expected to increase in the future.\\nCompared to 1995–2014, under the SSP5-8.5 emissions scenario, average precipitation is\\nprojected to increase by 8% (2%–13%) in the mid-21st century and by 17% (8%–27%) in the\\nlate 21st century. Precipitation increases of more than 25% are expected in northern China,\\nInner Mongolia, eastern northwest China, and the Tibetan Plateau, while areas south of the\\nYangtze River are expected to see an increase of about 10%.\\n\\nFrom 1961 to 2022, the frequency of extreme high-temperature events in China showed a\\nsignificant upward trend, with distinct periodic changes. Since the late 1990s, the frequency\\nof such events has been notably high (Figure 3-6(a)). The frequency of extreme daily\\nprecipitation events also increased (Figure 3-6(b)). Regional drought events exhibited clear\\ndecadal variation, with higher frequencies observed from the late 1970s to the 1980s, lower\\nfrequencies in the 1990s, higher frequencies from 2003 to 2008, and an overall decline since\\n2009 (Figure 3-6(c)).\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n135\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWater resources are one of the areas most directly and sensitively affected by climate change.\\nClimate change has intensified the spatial and temporal imbalance in the distribution of water\\nresources, increased the frequency of extreme water-related events, and, along with rising\\ntemperatures and increased evaporation, has overall increased the vulnerability of water\\nresource systems, raising risks for their development and utilization.\\n1. Observed Impacts\\n\\nHydrological patterns and water cycle processes in certain river basins and regions across\\nChina have shown varying degrees of change, although the basic characteristics of water\\ndistribution in terms of summer floods, winter droughts, water scarcity in the north, and\\nabundance in the south remain unchanged. Over the past 60 years, the overall observed runoff\\nof major rivers has shown a declining trend, with different characteristics across various river\\nbasins. Northern rivers, such as the Liao River, Songhua River, Yellow River and Hai River,\\nhave seen a general trend of decreasing runoff, whereas southern rivers, such as those in the\\nYangtze River Basin, the Pearl River Basin and Southeastern rivers, have not shown\\nsignificant changes in runoff patterns over the years.\\n\\n In terms of regions, surface water resources in areas such as the\\nSonghua River, Yangtze River, Pearl River and Southeastern rivers have seen an overall\\n[32] The observed impacts and evaluation results for future potential impacts are sourced from publicly\\navailable official data, as well as published literature and publications that have undergone peer review.\\nPart III Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation\\n136\\nincreasing trend, while the Liao River, Hai River, Yellow River, Huai River and Southwestern\\nrivers have seen a decreasing trend. The rate of increase or decrease in regional water\\nresources has varied in different time periods. For example, compared to 1956 to 1979,\\nsurface water resources in the Yangtze River Basin increased by 7.1% and 0.1% from 1980 to\\n2000 and 2001 to 2018, respectively, while those in the Yellow River Basin decreased by\\n9.3% and 14.0% over the same periods.\\n Between 2001 and 2016, China’s\\ngroundwater resources saw a slight decline compared to 1956–1979 and 1980–2000, with\\nnoticeable regional variations. In northern regions, the groundwater resources of the\\nNorthwestern rivers, Songhua River, and Huai River areas showed some growth, while those\\nin the Hai River, Liao River, and Yellow River regions experienced slight declines.\\n2. Future Potential Impacts\\nUnder a 2.0°C warming scenario, it is projected that future runoff in 14 out of 19 river basins\\nin China will increase due to sustained increases in precipitation. Compared to 1971–2000,\\nfive sites in cold, high-altitude areas may experience decreases in future runoff, with\\nevapotranspiration increasing significantly by 10%–20%. Annual average runoff in the\\nheadwaters of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers is likely to continue decreasing, mainly due to\\nsignificant temperature increases. By the mid-21st century, the vulnerability of water resource\\nsystems will increase overall, and areas classified as moderately vulnerable or higher will\\nexpand significantly. The suddenness, extremeness, and irregularity of water-related disasters\\nare expected to become more pronounced, and new issues such as water scarcity, ecological\\nwater damage, and water pollution will become increasingly urgent.\\n\\nClimate change impacts on China’s terrestrial ecosystems vary significantly across regions,\\nwith negative effects outweighing positive effects overall. Forest distribution is shifting\\nnorthward, productivity is increasing, the growing season is lengthening; forest areas in the\\nnorth are shrinking, while tropical rainforest areas are expanding; and fire and pest risks are\\nintensifying. Grassland productivity varies by region, with vulnerability increasing; wetland\\narea is expanding in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, while wetlands are severely degrading in\\nnortheast China. Desertification is expanding, with structural and functional changes in desert\\necosystems. The distribution range of wild species are shifting, habitats or suitable ranges are\\ndecreasing, and climate change risks to endangered and rare species are increasing.\\n1. Observed Impacts\\n\\n Over the past 60 years, the start of the forest\\nvegetation growing season has generally advanced, by an average of 2.55 days per decade,\\nwhile the end has generally been delayed by an average of 1.98 days per decade. Climate\\nchange has led to an increase in the suitable distribution area of tropical rainforest species,\\nwhile the suitable distribution area of subtropical evergreen species has decreased. The\\nsouthern boundary of northern deciduous coniferous species has shifted northward, with a\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n137\\nreduction in distribution area. The distribution range of needle- and broad-leaved tree species\\nin Northeast China has shifted northward. Net primary productivity (NPP) has significantly\\nincreased in areas such as the eastern edges of Northeast China, southeastern Shaanxi,\\nsouthern Yunnan, and eastern Guangxi. Since 2000, increased precipitation in northern China\\nhas led to improved vegetation quality in the Three-North Shelterbelt region. Climate\\nwarming will increase the risk of forest fires. Warming also supports insect overwintering,\\nwhich exacerbates pest severity, and high-altitude forest areas face a heightened risk of pest\\noutbreaks.\\n\\n Grassland plant green-up has advanced slightly, yellowing has been delayed, and\\nthe growing season has lengthened. Alpine meadows on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are\\nshifting northward, with species diversity and community stability decreasing in alpine\\ngrasslands. The productivity of alpine grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and southern\\ngrasslands is significantly increasing, while typical steppe and desert steppe productivity is\\ndecreasing. Increased precipitation in western grassland regions has had variable effects on\\nforage yield and livestock carrying capacity, with southwestern Xinjiang and eastern Tibet\\nexperiencing the greatest increases, while productivity has declined in northern and eastern\\nXinjiang and southern Qinghai.\\n From 1990\\nto 2021, the total area of lakes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau increased by 10,689 square\\nkilometers, and the total number of lakes increased by 423. Rising temperatures have led to\\nglacier melting and permafrost thawing, which was the primary driver of lake expansion in\\nthe endorheic basin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Marsh wetlands on the Qinghai-Tibet\\nPlateau have undergone severe degradation. Between 1970 and 2010, freshwater marshes,\\nsalt marshes, and marshy meadows decreased by 46.6%, 53.9%, and 15.6%, respectively, and\\nbetween 2008 and 2016, the riverine wetland area on the Plateau increased by 3.5%. From\\n1980 to 2015, northeast China experienced severe marsh wetland degradation, with a 30.8%\\ndecrease in wetland area and a 69.8% increase in patchiness. Climate warming threatens\\nbiodiversity within wetland systems, leading to declines in population sizes.\\n Warming has led\\nto increased evaporation, intensifying water scarcity, constrained vegetation growth, and\\ndecreasing NPP in desert ecosystems. Climate change exacerbates soil erosion in desert\\necosystems, further accelerating land degradation and desertification. Persistent warming and\\nreduced\\nprecipitation\\nalter\\nthe\\ncomposition\\nof\\nmosses,\\nlichens\\nand\\ncyanobacteria\\ncommunities in deserts, reducing moss abundance, cover and biomass, while increasing\\ninfiltration and evaporation in biological soil crusts, heightening\\ndesert ecosystem\\nvulnerability.\\n\\n More than 100 reptile species, 80~100\\namphibian species, and 400~600 bird species have shifted northward and westward, and the\\ndistribution range of over 120~200 mammalian species has changed. Climate change\\nsignificantly affects the distribution ranges of wild plants, primarily causing northward\\nPart III Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation\\n138\\nmigrations, with mosses being the most responsive to climate change. The ranges of over\\n1,000 angiosperm species have shifted, while ferns and gymnosperms have been less affected.\\n2. Future Potential Impacts\\n\\n Under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5[33] scenarios, the end\\ndate of the vegetation growing season in China is projected to be delayed by 8 days, 13.4\\ndays, 15.6 days, and 24.2 days, respectively, by the end of the 21st century. Future warming\\nwill support the migration of forests to higher elevations and latitudes. Northern and\\ntemperate deciduous forests, temperate evergreen coniferous forests, and tropical forest belts\\nwill migrate northward, with the area of tropical and warm temperate forests expanding while\\nthe area of temperate and northern forests may decrease. Climate change will alter forest NPP.\\nMulti-model ensemble assessments indicate that in an RCP2.6 scenario, the forest area with\\nreduced NPP will decrease, while under RCP8.5, forest areas with reduced NPP are expected\\nto increase after 2050. Plantations are particularly susceptible to extreme events and pest\\ninfestations, leading to lower productivity and decreased ecological benefits. Under all RCP\\nscenarios, the probability of forest fires in China from 2021 to 2050 is projected to increase,\\nwith North China showing the most significant rise.\\n\\n Rising temperatures will cause the alpine grassland boundary to shift to higher\\nelevations. Due to warming, the area of alpine meadows on the Tibetan Plateau will decrease\\nwhile the alpine steppe area will increase, and the suitable area for temperate grasslands will\\nshrink. Compared to 1987–2016, total biomass in grasslands is projected to undergo a\\nsignificant decline in both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. NPP in alpine grassland\\necosystems will decrease. In most of western Inner Mongolia, the NPP of grasslands will\\ndecline, while in the northeast, meadow and typical grassland, NPP will increase. Soil carbon\\nstocks in alpine meadow, alpine steppe, temperate meadow steppe, typical steppe, alpine\\ndesert and temperate desert are all expected to decline.\\n\\n In the RCP8.5 scenario, climate suitability for wetlands in\\nNortheast China will shrink significantly, with severe wetland degradation anticipated.\\nApproximately 30% of the wetlands in the Greater Khingan Range will vanish by 2050 and\\n60% by 2100. Changes in the distribution of alpine wetlands on the Tibetan Plateau and a\\nreduction in its area are projected due to future climate change scenarios, with key wetland\\nfunctions (such as carbon sequestration, water retention and habitat provision) facing risk.\\n Under the RCP4.5 scenario, the\\narea of desertified land in China’s arid regions is expected to continue expanding, especially\\nin western regions where desertification will intensify, but under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5\\nscenarios the desertified area may slightly decrease.\\n[33] RCP refers to Representative Concentration Pathways.\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n139\\n\\n\\n Under future climate change, China’s wildlife ranges will shrink\\nsignificantly, habitats will degrade, and 5–20% of species will face a high risk of\\nendangerment or extinction. The distribution range of moss species will decrease, their\\nhabitats are projected to degrade, and some of them will migrate to the west. ferns will\\nmigrate to higher elevations and latitudes, while the suitable habitat for gymnosperms will\\ndecrease and fragment. Most angiosperms will migrate westward with a reduced range of\\nsuitable habitats, and 9–34% of wild plant species will face high endangerment risk.\\nAdditionally, climate change, particularly rising temperatures, will cause harmful algal\\nblooms to increase in scale and frequency, posing an increased threat to production of other\\naquatic plants.\\n\\nIn the context of continued ocean warming and increasing climate hazard factors, sea level\\nrise in coastal China seas is evident, and the exposure of coastal ecosystems and economic\\nand social assets in coastal areas is increasing, along with climate vulnerability and\\ncomprehensive risk.\\n1. Observed Impacts\\n\\nSince the 1960s, climate warming has caused notable increases in SST and sea level in\\ncoastal China seas, particularly accelerating sea level rise in the 21st century. The annual\\naverage SST increased by 1.02±0.19°C from 1960 to 2022, far above the global ocean\\naverage, with especially pronounced warming in winter. The Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea and East\\nChina Sea (collectively referred to as the East China Seas (ECS)) exhibited SST rises of\\n1.95±0.38°C and 1.26±0.32°C in winter and summer, respectively, with warming rates\\nreaching 0.31°C/decade and 0.20°C/decade, 2 to 3 times the global ocean average during the\\nsame period (Figure 3-7). The South China Sea (SCS) experienced relatively lower annual\\nSST increase rates of 0.19°C/decade in winter and 0.14°C/decade in summer. The sea level\\nchanges along China’s coast have shown an accelerating upward trend. From 1980 to 2022,\\nChina’s coastal sea level rose at a rate of 3.5 mm/year, and from 1993 to 2022, the rate\\nincreased to 4.0 mm/year from 1993 to 2022, exceeding the global ocean average for the\\nsame period[34].\\n[34] China Sea Level Bulletin 2022.\\nPart III Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation\\n140\\n\\n\\n \\uf0b0\\n\\n From 1982 to 2022, the frequency and intensity of marine\\nheatwaves (MHWs) in China’s coastal waters showed a marked upward trend, with the\\nnorthern SCS (particularly Beibu Gulf in Guangxi) and the waters adjacent to the Yangtze\\nRiver Estuary being the most frequently affected, averaging over 25 MHW days per year.\\nMarine heatwaves have severely impacted marine organisms, ecosystems and aquaculture in\\nthe coastal China sea. For instance, an extreme MHW event in August 2018 in the Yellow and\\nBohai Seas caused mass mortality of cultured sea cucumbers, resulting in economic losses of\\naround RMB 15 billion.\\n\\n Since 1980, the warming seas have intensified\\nnutrient imbalance, ocean acidification and hypoxia zones, particularly in the Yangtze and\\nPearl River estuaries. Ocean warming has altered marine phenology, affecting biological\\ngrowth and development cycles, shifting species composition and the geographic distribution\\nof species, and increasing the frequency of marine ecological disasters, such as red tides,\\ngreen tides, and jellyfish blooms. Marine ecosystem vulnerability has markedly increased,\\nwith decadal increases in red tides in the Yangtze Estuary and adjacent waters.

Rising temperatures have lengthened\\nthe crop growing season while shortening the growth period, moving further northward of\\nthe northern planting boundary of rice in Northeast China, winter wheat in North and\\nNorthwest China, and corn in Northeast and Northwest China, extending multiple cropping\\nboundaries to higher latitudes and altitudes, and increasing multiple cropping areas and\\ncropping indexes. The boundaries for medium and medium-late maturing crop varieties have\\nshifted northward expanding in area. Heat- and drought-tolerant crops have expanded in area,\\nwith optimal planting periods occurring earlier. Early- and medium-maturing varieties have\\ngradually transitioned to late-maturing types, and strongly cold-tolerant crops are gradually\\nreplaced by cold-tolerant and weakly cold-tolerant crops. From 1960 to 2020, effective\\nprecipitation during the crop growing period did not show a significant trend, while total\\nradiation decreased, reducing sunshine hours. From 1981 to 2007, annual sunshine hours\\nduring the crop growing season decreased by 125.7 hours compared to 1961–1980, resulting\\nin a decreased photosynthesis for some crops.\\n\\n\\n Warming has increased overwintering pest populations, advancing their first\\nappearance, migration and outbreak periods, and extending the duration of infestations. Major\\ncrop pest species and populations have shown increased growth and reproductive cycles, with\\nincreased severity of damage. The northern boundary of pest and disease occurrence has\\nshifted northward, with the upper elevation limit rising and damage zones expanding. In\\nwarm winter years, the northern boundary of rice planthopper overwintering in China can\\nshift 2–4 latitudinal degrees northward. Warmer winters have led to earlier and more severe\\noutbreaks of wheat stripe rust and fusarium head blight, with the onset of occurrence shifting\\nfrom March to February. Previous researches indicate that for each 1°C rise in average annual\\ntemperature, the area affected by disease increases by 60.944 million hectares, and for each\\n100-hour reduction in average annual sunshine, the affected area rises by 34.188 million\\nhectares. From 1970 to 2016, the rate of crop pest and disease occurrence rapidly increased,\\nwith climate warming contributing to over 1/5th of the increase in pest and disease incidence.\\nAnnual growth rates of pest and disease occurrences in staple grains, including wheat, maize\\nand rice, have notably increased, with the\\ndamage degree rising by 10%–20% under\\nwarming climate.\\n\\n\\n In the past 50 years (1961–2014), both the scope and severity\\nof agricultural drought disaster have significantly risen, with comprehensive loss rates\\nincreasing by an average of 0.5% per decade. Agricultural flooding rates caused by extreme\\nprecipitation events have generally trended upwards.

The frequency of low-temperature freeze damage has significantly declined, but\\nwarmer winters have shortened overwintering periods for crops, such as wheat and rapeseed,\\ncausing earlier heading and bolting, making them more vulnerable to late-spring frosts and\\nincreasing cold-damage risk. Additionally, the frequent and simultaneous occurrence of\\nagricultural meteorological disasters has increased the risk of compound disasters.\\n\\n Higher temperatures in Northeast China contribute\\nto yield increasing of corn, rice, and soybeans; in the Huang-Huai-Hai region, warming and\\ndrying trends limit yield increase for wheat and maize; in South China, rising temperatures,\\nhigh frequent heavy rains, and intensified pest and disease issues affect rice yield\\nimprovement and quality; and in the arid and semi-arid areas of Northwest China, the\\nagricultural water use is declining and the crop productivity is inhibited. Long-term trials\\nacross multiple sites indicate that for each 1°C increase in average temperature during\\ngrowing season, corn yields decline by 0.83 tons per hectare, and for each 100 MJ reduction\\nin cumulative photosynthetically active radiation, corn yields decrease by 0.85 tons per\\nhectare. For each 1°C rise in temperature, early rice yields drop by 8%, with no negative\\nimpact observed on late rice yields. From 1961 to 2010, rising average temperatures during\\ncrop growing seasons have led to a 5.5% reduction in nationwide winter wheat yields. From\\n1981 to 2009, reduced radiation levels caused yield declines of 1.5%–8.7% in rice-wheat\\nrotation systems.\\n2. Potential Future Impacts\\n\\n\\n Compared to the 2000s, the average temperature during the rice growing\\nseason in China is projected to increase by 1.7°C to 3.4°C in the 2050s and by 2.3°C to 4.1°C\\nin the 2070s. In a scenario where temperatures increase by 2.0°C, the growth period of corn\\nin China is projected to shorten by 10.8% to 22.5%, and that of wheat by 6.9%; under the\\nsame warming scenario, rice growth period would shorten by 4.5 to 18 days, and wheat by 8\\nto 18 days. Climate warming is expected to cause China\\'s multi-cropping boundary to\\ncontinue to expand to high latitudes and high altitudes. In a medium GHG emission scenario\\n(A1B), over the next 20-30 years, the boundaries for double-cropping and triple-cropping\\nareas will likely shift northward to varying extents.\\n\\n A warmer climate is\\nconducive to the overwintering and reproduction of crop pathogens, increasing risks in\\npreviously cooler climate zones. The northern migration times of pests in spring are expected\\nto start earlier, with fall migrations southward occurring later, and the geographic range of\\ndiseases will be expanded. The risk of outbreaks and disasters from warm-temperature and\\ncold-sensitive pests and diseases will significantly increase. The safe overwintering boundary\\nfor crop pests will shift northward, and the number of generations of pests will rise. The area\\nof highly suitable and moderately suitable habitats for fruit tree pests will increase. Rising\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n145\\ntemperatures and increased precipitation will accelerate the volatilization, degradation and\\nloss of pesticide ingredients. With climate factors compounding, future pesticide usage is\\nprojected to rise significantly.\\n\\n Climate change and extreme climate events will\\nlead to fluctuations in grain production in China with extreme climate events occurring more\\nfrequently. Rising temperatures and uneven precipitation will heighten the risk of heat stress,\\ndroughts and floods, which will make rice, corn, soybeans, rapeseed and cotton yields in\\nChina more unstable and vulnerable. Between 2021 and 2070, under various RCP scenarios,\\nheat stress events will increase significantly, with the largest increase under the RCP8.5\\nscenario. In particular, high-temperature stress will become more frequent during the heading,\\nflowering and maturation stages of rice in the Yangtze River basin.\\n\\n Without\\nconsidering the CO₂ fertilization effect, crop yields are projected to decline in the 2020s,\\n2050s, and 2090s. Even when considering this effect, CO₂ fertilization cannot counteract the\\nyield reduction caused by climate change after the 2050s. Under a 2.0°C warming scenario,\\nthe yields of single cropping rice, early rice and late rice are projected to decrease by 5.3%,\\n4.3% and 5.8%, respectively. Wheat yields are expected to increase by 8.6%, while corn\\nyields will decrease by 1.7%. Although future increases in atmospheric CO₂ concentration\\nwill help counterbalance some adverse effects of rising temperatures, it will reduce the\\nprotein content in grain crops, affecting their nutritional quality. Studies indicate that once\\nCO₂ concentrations reach 550 ppm, the protein content of wheat, corn, rice and soybeans will\\ndecrease by approximately 5.0% to 7.8%.\\n\\n\\n As a populous country undergoing a\\nrapid aging process, China is situated in a region highly affected by climate change. Climate\\nchange can impact public health through various complex pathways, causing injuries and\\nincreasing risks and burdens of both infectious and non- communicable chronic diseases.\\n1. Observed Impacts\\n\\n The number of heatwave-related deaths in China rose from 3,680 in the 1980s to\\n15,500 in the 2010s, peaking at a record high in 2022, with a clear upward and accelerating\\ntrend. Between 2010 and 2019, the rate of increase in heatwave-related deaths was 2.8 times\\nthat between 1980 and 2009. The most vulnerable groups to heatwaves include the elderly,\\nindividuals with chronic underlying health conditions, women, outdoor workers, and low-\\nincome populations.\\n Compared to\\n1986–2005, the climatic suitability index for dengue virus transmission increased by 68% in\\nPart III Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation\\n146\\n2021, expanding the area suitable for its spread. Within a certain temperature range, every\\n1°C increase in maximum temperature is associated with to a 11.9% increase in dengue\\nincidence, a 15.8% increase in malaria incidence, and a 1.6% increase in the incidence of\\nhemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.\\n A study of\\n272 major cities in China found that approximately 14.33% of non-accidental mortality was\\nrelated to suboptimal temperatures, with the highest mortality rates associated with moderate\\ncold and moderate heat. In particular, temperature-related cardiovascular mortality accounted\\nfor about 17.48%, and respiratory disease mortality for approximately 10.57%. In cities with\\ntemperate and subtropical monsoon climates and high urbanization but limited centralized\\nheating, the health risks and disease burdens associated with suboptimal temperatures were\\nmore pronounced. Other studies show that high temperatures and heatwaves significantly\\nincrease the risk of circulatory system diseases and their subtypes; they include ischemic\\nheart disease, stroke, myocardial infarction and arrhythmias. Cold spells elevate mortality\\nfrom ischemic heart disease, heart attack, ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. Between\\n1961 and 2020, heatwaves and cold spells caused health-related economic losses of about\\nRMB 1.28 trillion and RMB 1.51 trillion, respectively. Research also indicates that\\nsuboptimal temperatures can negatively affect mental health, with older adults, women, those\\nwith lower education levels, and agricultural workers being particularly affected by high\\ntemperatures.\\n2. Future Potential Impacts\\n\\n Compared to 1986–2005, the frequency\\nof heatwaves in China will increase by 10.3, 5.2 and 2.6 times by the end of the 21st century\\nunder the RCP8.5, RCP4.5, and RCP2.6 scenarios, respectively. Under the high-emission\\nRCP8.5 scenario, heatwave-related deaths in China are projected to continue rising, reaching\\nan annual average of 72,259 by the end of the century. The projected increase in heatwave-\\nrelated deaths in China will be driven mainly by rapidly rising temperatures, population\\ngrowth and the degree of aging, with climate effects playing a primary role. Furthermore, the\\nburden of heatwave-related deaths will display significant spatial heterogeneity, with nearly\\nhalf of the deaths occurring in eastern and central China, covering urban clusters in the\\nShandong Peninsula, the North China Plain and the Yangtze River Delta.\\n The\\nnumber of people in China exposed to vector-borne Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus\\nmosquitoes is expected to rise significantly, with high-risk areas for dengue fever expanding\\nfurther. Under the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios, by 2100 dengue high-risk areas\\nwill encompass 277 counties (districts) with a population of 233 million and 456 counties\\n(districts) with a population of 490 million, respectively. China is also likely to become a\\nhigh-risk area for bacterial dysentery. Compared to 2014–2016, by the end of the 21st century,\\nthe attributable risk of bacterial dysentery is projected to increase by 20% in North China,\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n147\\n15% in Northeast China, 12% in Northwest China, and 11% in South China[38].\\n\\nClimate change has already affected the safe operation of infrastructure and major projects in\\nChina. Under future climate change scenarios, the risks will continue to increase,\\nnecessitating close attention to the adverse impacts of climate change. For instance,\\nsignificant changes have been observed in the permafrost along the Qinghai-Tibet Railway,\\nwhich may impact the stability of the railway’s foundation. From 1996 to 2006, the average\\nannual temperature of permafrost at a depth of 6.0 meters increased by approximately 0.43°C,\\nwith an average warming rate of 0.39°C per decade. Between 1996 and 2007, the average\\nthickness of the active layer along the Qinghai-Tibet Railway increased by 46 cm, with an\\naverage rate of increase of 5.8 cm per year. If temperatures rise by 2.0°C after 2050,\\npermafrost that is extremely unstable under high-temperatures will fully degrade into\\nseasonal permafrost; and permafrost that is unstable under high-temperatures will mostly\\ntransform into extremely unstable permafrost. If temperatures rise by 2.6°C by 2050, highly\\nunstable permafrost may transform into seasonal permafrost around 2030, and after 2050\\nsome high-temperature unstable permafrost areas may also transition to seasonal permafrost.\\n\\nClimate change has already caused varying degrees of impact across different sectors, with\\nrelated losses and damages continuously increasing, particularly in recent years as extreme\\nweather and climate events have caused significant economic losses and casualties. In\\nresponse, the Chinese government has taken proactive strategies, policies and actions to avoid,\\nmitigate and address losses and damages associated with climate change impacts. See\\nChapter III of this part for more details.\\n1. Losses and Damages Caused by Meteorological Disasters\\nFrom 2020 to 2021, China experienced severe losses due to heavy rain and flooding.\\nRegional and seasonal droughts were notable, although the damage caused was relatively less\\nsevere. Relatively fewer typhoons were generated or made landfall, resulting in minimal\\nlosses. There were numerous high-temperature days, with extreme temperatures particularly\\nintense in the south. Strong convective weather showed concentrated spatial and temporal\\ndistribution with relatively minor losses, and low-temperature freezing damage and snow\\ndisasters were mild. In 2022, regional and seasonal droughts became pronounced, with\\ncontinuous summer-autumn drought affecting the Yangtze River basin. Heavy rain occurred\\nfrequently, leading to severe flooding in South China, Northeast China and Northwest China,\\nand flood situations emerged in the Pearl River and Song-Liao River basins. There was an\\nabnormally low number of landfalling typhoons, but those that did occur had strong intensity\\nand broad impact areas.

It incorporates climate change adaptation concepts and requirements into medium-\\nand long-term plans for national economic and social development.\\nThe Outline of the 12th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development of the\\nPeople’s Republic of China included a dedicated chapter on “actively cope with global\\nPart III Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation\\n150\\nclimate change” for the first time, stating in the section “increase adaptability to climate\\nchange” that a “We will formulate an overall national strategy for combating climate change\\nand strengthen our scientific research and observation to influence our analysis of climate\\nchange.” Climate change factors should be fully considered in the layout of productivity,\\ninfrastructure, and the planning and construction of major projects. Increasing adaptability to\\nclimate change, particularly in response to extreme climate events, should be prioritized,\\naccelerating research and promotion of adaptation technologies and enhancing adaptation\\nlevels in key sectors like agriculture, forestry, and water resources, as well as in coastal and\\necologically vulnerable areas. Improved monitoring, early warning, and prevention of\\nextreme weather and climate events should be emphasized to bolster the capability to defend\\nagainst and reduce natural disasters.\\nThe Outline of the 13th Five-year Plan for National Economic and Social Development of the\\nPeople\\'s Republic of China continued to dedicate a chapter to “Respond to Global Climate\\nChange,” with the section on “Proactively Adapting to Climate Change” emphasizing the\\nneed to consider climate change in activities such as urban and rural planning, infrastructure\\nconstruction, and productivity layout. It highlighted timely development and adjustment of\\nrelevant technical standards, the implementation of climate change adaptation action plans,\\nstrengthening systematic observation and scientific research on climate change, improving\\nforecasting and early warning systems, and enhancing the ability to cope with extreme\\nweather and climate events.\\nThe Outline of the 14th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development and\\nLong-Range Objectives Through the Year 2035 of the People’s Republic of China specified in\\nthe chapter on “Coping with climate change” that “we will intensify the observation and\\nassessment of the impact of global warming on vulnerable areas in China, and enhance the\\ncapacity of urban and rural construction, agricultural production, and infrastructure, to adapt\\nto climate change.” New requirements for the next stage of climate change adaptation work\\nwere laid out.\\n\\nTo proactively respond to global climate change and coordinate climate change adaptation\\nefforts nationwide, nine Chinese government departments jointly issued the National Climate\\nChange Adaptation Strategy in 2013 (implementation period: 2014–2020). This strategy\\ndefined key tasks for infrastructure, agriculture, water resources, coastal areas and associated\\nmarine areas, forests and other ecosystems, human health, tourism, and other sectors to adapt\\nto climate change. Following the relevant land and spatial development contents in the\\nnational main functional area plan, the strategy proposed specific adaptation tasks with\\nvarying focuses based on the impacts of climate change on different regions’ livelihoods,\\ndividing key regions in China into three main adaptation zones: urbanization, agricultural\\ndevelopment, and ecological security. This division provides guidance for coordinated\\nclimate change adaptation efforts across regions. As China’s first strategic plan specifically\\ntargeting climate change adaptation, the National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy is\\nsignificant for enhancing China’s comprehensive climate adaptability. The strategy adheres to\\nprinciples of prioritizing key areas, proactive adaptation, reasonable adaptation, coordinated\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n151\\ncollaboration, and broad participation. It set an overall goal of significantly enhancing\\nadaptability, fully implementing key tasks, and forming a basic regional adaptation\\nframework by 2020, thus providing guidance for coordinated adaptation efforts.\\nTo further reinforce climate change adaptation, in June 2022, the MEE, along with 17 other\\ndepartments, jointly issued the National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy 2035, outlining\\nkey tasks such as climate change monitoring, prediction, early warning, and risk management,\\nenhancing the adaptability of natural ecosystems, strengthening the adaptability of economic\\nand social systems, and building a regional adaptation framework. The strategy considers\\nmultiple dimensions, including climate risks and adaptation, key sectors and regional\\nframeworks, and natural ecosystems and economic society, providing strategic basis and\\nguidance for improving climate resilience and effectively mitigating the adverse impacts and\\nrisks of climate change.\\nThe National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy 2035 highlights “Reinforce Climate\\nChange Monitoring, Prediction, Early Warning, and Risk Management” as a separate chapter\\nand places it in a prominent position, reflecting the importance given to climate change\\nmonitoring, prediction, early warning, impact and risk assessment, and emergency disaster\\nprevention and mitigation. Key areas are categorized into two dimensions: natural ecosystems\\nand economic society. Urban and rural living environments, as well as sensitive secondary\\nand tertiary industries such as finance, energy, tourism, and transportation, are added as\\npriority areas for climate adaptation, helping to further enhance adaptability across all sectors.\\nThe integration of climate change adaptation with land and spatial planning is established,\\nwith tasks for adapting to climate change across eight major regions and five key strategic\\nareas proposed based on the principles of full coverage and key highlights, forming a multi-\\nlayered regional framework for climate change adaptation. Specific goals for 2025, 2030, and\\n2035 are set out in terms of the policy and institutional framework for climate change\\nadaptation, climate change monitoring, prediction, and early warning, impact and risk\\nassessment, disaster prevention and control capacity-building, actions in key fields and key\\nregions, the adaptation regional framework, adaptation technologies and standards, and the\\nbuilding of a climate-resilient society.\\n\\nAs a crucial part of climate change response, climate change adaptation has been\\nincorporated into the policy systems of relevant departments such as the State Council and its\\nsubordinate Ministry of Natural Resources, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs,\\nMinistry of Water Resources, National Forestry and Grassland Administration, and China\\nMeteorological Administration. From 2020 to 2022, the Central Committee of the\\nCommunist Party of China, the State Council, and relevant ministries formulated and issued\\ndocuments in 13 specific areas of climate change adaptation. These included climate impact\\nand risk assessment, comprehensive disaster prevention and reduction, water resources,\\nterrestrial ecosystems, marine and coastal zones, agriculture and food security, health and\\npublic health, urban and living environments, enhancing tourism adaptability, improving\\nclimate resilience in the energy sector, disaster prevention and emergency preparedness in\\ntransportation, spatial planning for climate change adaptation, and adaptation in key strategic\\nPart III Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation\\n152\\nareas. These documents have effectively guided and promoted the implementation of\\nadaptation efforts in key sectors, yielding substantial progress. The goals for each sector are\\nas follows:\\n By 2025, China aims to significantly enhance capabilities for flood and\\ndrought defense, secure and intensive utilization of water resources, optimized allocation of\\nwater resources, and ecological protection and restoration of rivers and lakes, thereby greatly\\nimproving national water security. The country’s total water consumption will be kept below\\n640 billion cubic meters, with water consumption per RMB 10,000 of GDP and per RMB\\n10,000 of industrial added value reduced by approximately 16% compared to 2020 levels,\\nand the effective utilization coefficient of agricultural irrigation water raised to 0.58. The\\nwater resources allocation project system will be further improved, with an additional 29\\nbillion cubic meters of water supply capacity from new water projects, nearly all prefecture-\\nlevel and above cities having established emergency backup water sources, and rural tap\\nwater coverage reaching 88%.\\n By 2025, key ecological zones of national importance, ecological\\nprotection redlines, and priority national nature reserves will focus on ecosystem protection\\nand restoration, addressing core ecological issues in critical areas.

A major service bulletin system has been established for the joint release\\nof major precipitation processes such as typhoons and rainstorms. On April 15, 2022, the\\nnational-level geohazard meteorological risk warning system for geological disasters was\\nlaunched. The Technical Guidelines for Climate Change Impact and Risk Assessment (Trial)\\nwas compiled and the Outline for High Quality Development of Meteorology (2022-2035)\\nwas issued. Investigation into meteorological disaster-causing factors and risk assessment\\nhave been completed. The Blue Book on Climate Change of China 2023, the Blue Book on\\nMarine Climate Change of China 2022, the China Climate Bulletin (2021, and 2022), the\\nNational Eco-meteorological Bulletin 2022, the Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, and the China\\nWind and Solar Energy Resources Bulletin were released. Additionally, the Polar Climate\\nChange Annual Report was also newly introduced. The Regional Climate Change Assessment\\nReport of China and the National Climate Change Assessment Report were also completed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n The 14th Five-Year Plan for National Comprehensive Disaster Prevention\\nand Reduction was issued, deploying major projects for comprehensive disaster prevention\\nand reduction to adapt to climate change. The establishment of a joint mechanism and the\\ncreation of national comprehensive disaster reduction demonstration communities have\\nenhanced grassroots capacities in this regard. Key projects for the prevention and control of\\nnatural disasters have been promoted, optimizing the regional distribution of disaster\\nprevention, mitigation, and relief resources. The promotion of nine key projects for natural\\ndisaster prevention and control has helped to improve the monitoring, early warning, and\\ncomprehensive risk prevention system for natural disasters. The first national comprehensive\\nnatural disaster risk survey was completed, leading to the establishment of a national\\ncomprehensive natural disaster risk basic database. The implementation of information\\ntechnology projects for natural disaster monitoring and early warning has been accelerated. A\\nreward mechanism for reporting illegal and irregular outdoor fire use in forests and\\ngrasslands has been established. The second phase of the forest lightning fire prevention and\\ncontrol technology research project has been initiated. The construction of the forest and\\ngrassland fire prevention perception system was accelerated. Fire risk assessment and real-\\ntime fire monitoring based on changes in weather conditions have been strengthened. Efforts\\nto strengthen disaster prevention and mitigation technology research and development were\\nsupported, with significant natural disaster risk prevention and emergency rescue included in\\nthe relevant key special implementation scheme of the 14th Five-Year National Key Research\\nand Development Plan and the project guide of 2021. A distinctive Chinese emergency rescue\\nforce system has been established, featuring the national comprehensive fire rescue team as\\nthe core force, professional rescue teams for coordination, military emergency forces for\\nrapid response, and social forces providing support. Six national and regional emergency\\nrescue centers have been established. Furthermore, the emergency rescue aviation system has\\nbeen strengthened, including the breakthrough in large firefighting aircraft and enhancing\\naviation rescue capabilities. A robust emergency rescue command mechanism has been\\ndeveloped. Emergency drills were organized. Reconstruction of disaster-damaged rural\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n155\\nhousing has accelerated. A technical expert steering group for post-disaster farmhouse\\nrestoration and reconstruction was established, and it provided guidance for the restoration\\nefforts in various regions. Since 2022, effective measures have been taken to prevent and\\ncontrol flood and drought disasters. Fourteen numbered floods in major rivers, 1,334 rivers\\nexperiencing warning level floods, and 76 rivers experiencing floods that broke records since\\ndata collection began were successfully managed. Safety in preventing ice floods in northern\\nrivers, such as the Yellow River, was ensured. In 2022, the significant flood in the Pearl River\\nBasin and Beijiang River\\'s largest flood since 1915 were effectively controlled, securing\\nflood control in the Pearl River Delta. The \\'\\'23·7\" (July 2023) super large flood in the Haihe\\nRiver Basin was actively defended against, safeguarding important cities and facilities like\\nDaxing Airport. Also in 2022, in response to the most severe and prolonged meteorological\\nand hydrological drought in the Yangtze River Basin since complete data was available in\\n1961, unprecedented intrusion of saltwater in the Yangtze River Estuary,, as well as the most\\nsevere drought in parts of Southwest and Northwest China since 1961 in 2023, ensuring\\nwater supply in drought-affected areas and seasonal irrigation demand for crops.\\n\\n\\n Surveys and evaluations on water resources, completing annual groundwater\\nlevel measurements and groundwater monitoring projects for China’s nine major river basins,\\necologically fragile regions, and water conservation areas were conducted. China has put\\nincreasing efforts into water resource conservation and management. China has explored the\\nestablishment of strict constraints on water usage. During the 14th Five-Year Plan period,\\nclear targets have been set for controlling the water consumption’s total volume and intensity\\nat both national and provincial levels. A National Water Conservation Campaign has been\\nadvanced across the board. In 2022, China’s water consumption per RMB 10,000 of GDP and\\nof industrial value-added reduced by 7.6% and 17.7%, respectively, compared to the 2020\\nlevels. Additionally, the coefficient of effective utilization of irrigation water in farmland has\\nbeen increased from 0.565 to 0.572, and the rural tap water coverage increased from 83% to\\n87%, the irrigated area for irrigation districts of over 10,000 acres expanded from 500 million\\nmu to 532 million mu, and the utilization of unconventional water sources grew from 13.2\\nbillion cubic meters to 17.58 billion cubic meters. These measures have significantly\\nimproved water consumption efficiency and effectiveness. China has actively promoted water\\nresource tax reform to enhance the conservation, development, and utilization of water\\nresources. China has implemented major projects on national water network and achieved\\nsignificant progress in several major projects. China has strengthened the climate adaptability\\nof water infrastructure by promoting the construction of water control and drought relief\\nimprovement projects, completing 11,000 kilometers of small and medium-sized river\\nmanagement, and undertaking remediation of 175 key mountain flood channels. China has\\nimplemented the Mother River Recovery Action to assure ecological flow, optimized water\\nresource allocation and management, implemented ecological water replenishment. These\\nmeasures have maintained year-round water flow in the Yongding River for 4 consecutive\\nyears after 26 years of intermittent flow, and achieved full connectivity of the Grand Canal\\nfor 3 consecutive years after a century of cutoff.

We issued the Marine Ecological Environment Protection Plan for the 14th Five-Year\\nand the Action Plan for Comprehensive Management of Key Sea Areas, emphasizing land-sea\\nand sea-river coordination, and advancing integrated management of key sea areas and the\\nbuilding of \\'\\'beautiful bays\\'\\'.\\n\\n We carried out the\\nthird national agricultural climate resource census and zoning, and promoted high-yield,\\nhigh-quality, and stress-resistant varieties suitable for different regions to improve grain yield\\nand crop climate adaptability. During critical periods such as the flood season and the \\'\\'Three\\nAutumn\\'\\' period (harvesting, ploughing and sowing in autumn), agricultural disaster\\nprevention and reduction plans were issued. We established designated field monitoring\\npoints and national soil moisture monitoring stations, promoting water-saving and drought-\\nresistant crop varieties and coverage, drip and sprinkler irrigation, and integrated water and\\nfertilizer technologies.. Based on shifts in ecological relationships due to climate change and\\nthe new characteristics of pests and diseases, we have advanced unified control and green\\nprevention\\ntechnologies,\\npromoted\\npesticide\\nreduction\\nand\\nefficiency\\nimprovement.\\nAdditionally, we have strengthened the prevention and control of invasive alien species by\\nestablishing\\na\\ncomprehensive\\nmanagement\\nsystem\\nencompassing\\nsource\\nprevention,\\nmonitoring, early warning, governance and restoration, to safeguard agricultural biodiversity.\\nWe established a food security system with climate adaptability, and strengthened the\\ndevelopment of high standard farmland to stabilize food production. Also, we implemented a\\nrobust system for fallow farmland rotation and increased investment in agricultural water\\nconservancy facilities. We carried out pilot demonstrations of climate-smart agriculture,\\nexplored innovative models tailored to various regions, targeting different crop types,\\nregional agricultural climate conditions, and cultivation methods used by farmers. Adhering\\nto the principles of \\'\\'government guidance, market-based operation, voluntary participation,\\nand coordinated promotion\\'\\', we implemented an agricultural insurance premium subsidy\\npolicy.\\n We expanded the demonstration in\\nenvironmental health risk assessment, and promoted pilot of environmental health risk\\nassessment, organized and carried out health risk classification and warning for heat waves\\nand cold waves, improved the public access to extreme weather health risk alerts, and\\npromoted its application in the first group of pilot cities of Jinan, Qingdao, and Shenzhen. We\\ndeveloped early warning products for high-temperature health risks and created a platform for\\n\\'\\'diagnosing\\'\\' urban climate change impacts. We convened national discussions on extreme\\nweather and issued cold wave health risk warnings for cardiovascular-sensitive populations.\\nAdditionally, we developed and published the Guidelines for Public Health Protection\\nAgainst Heat Waves, Guidelines for Public Health Protection Against Cold Waves, and\\nHealth Literacy and Interpretation of the Public Response to Climate Change to enhance\\nPart III Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation\\n158\\npublic awareness and improve response capabilities to climate-related health threats. We\\nadvanced the pilot of climate change health adaptation communities and implemented\\ncommunity health risk interventions for extreme weather events. To harness expert\\nknowledge and technical support, a Climate Change and Health Expert Committee was\\nestablished. We drafted the National Action Plan for Climate Change Health Adaptation\\n(2024-2030) and identified phased goals for climate change health adaptation, continuously\\nimproved the climate change health standard system, and accelerated the development of\\nbasic and technical standards.\\n We carried\\nout pilot projects, including key technologies for enhancing the resilience of transportation\\ninfrastructure. In the design review of key projects, we carried out safety assessments such as\\ngeological hazard evaluations, flood control impact assessments, and traffic safety\\nassessments. Essential safety measures such as lightning protection, earthquake resistance,\\nand (wind) diversion devices have been incorporated, with wind tunnel tests conducted to\\nverify the wind stability of large-span bridges. We guided the project to focus on high slopes,\\nsuper large bridges, tunnels and other construction sites. Construction emergency plans have\\nbeen developed to address potential disasters such as typhoon, rainstorm and the resulting\\nfloods, debris flows, landslides, collapses and other disasters. We have conducted studies to\\nimprove the standards of water transport engineering adaptive to climate change. During the\\nrevision of key standards such as the Code for General Design of Seaports, we have\\nconsidered the impact of climate change, such as sea level rise.\\n We have\\ncontinuously implemented the Action Plan for Urban Adaptation to Climate Change, taking\\ncities as the starting point, actively explored the path and model of building climate adaptive\\ncities. The Notice on Deepening the Pilot Program of Climate Adaptable City Construction\\nwas issued, proposing ten key tasks. Pilot selection for climate-adaptive city construction was\\norganized and carried out. Focus on addressing urban waterlogging, we carried out sponge\\ncity pilots in 30 cities and sponge city demonstrations in 60 cities. In 10 cities, we carried out\\npilot projects to enhance the system and mechanism of urban \\'\\'physical examination\\'\\', further\\nadjusted and improved the urban physical examination index system, incorporating metrics\\nsuch as \\'\\'reduction in severe waterlogging-prone areas\\'\\' and \\'\\'emergency rescue capability for\\nurban drainage and waterlogging prevention\\'\\', etc. into the index system. Through this system,\\nwe identified existing challenges in urban resilience against extreme weather, such as\\nrainstorms, and implemented targeted renovations to enhance urban safety and resilience.\\nChina issued the 14th Five-Year Plan for Urban Drainage and Flood Prevention System\\nConstruction Action Plan to guide the construction of urban drainage and flood control\\nsystems nationwide, and established a provincially coordinated emergency drainage work\\nmechanism. Twenty-six cities have been awarded the title of \\'\\'National Forest City\\'\\', with\\nmore than 100 cities having implemented on the national garden city initiative, and 3,520\\n\\'\\'pocket parks\\'\\' have been built across the country.

Since 2022, 18,000 dilapidated bridges on rural roads have been\\nrenovated, and 240,000 kilometers of rural road life safety protection projects have been\\nimplemented.\\n\\n The National Territorial Space\\nPlanning Outline (2021-2035) has been issued, completing the demarcation of the \\'\\'three\\nzones and three lines\\'\\' [40]”. We have been expediting the implementation of territorial space\\nplanning at provincial, municipal, and county levels, with a focus on prioritizing ecological\\nconsiderations and adapting to climate change as fundamental principles in territorial space\\nplanning. A new pattern of national territorial space development and protection has emerged,\\ncharacterized\\nby\\ndistinct\\nprimary\\nfunctions,\\ncomplementary\\nadvantages,\\nand\\nan\\nenvironmentally friendly, low-carbon approach, facilitated by spatial bottom-line constraints\\nand strategic guidance. Enhanced supervision has been observed in key ecological function\\nareas, ecological protection red lines, and other critical zones, leading to improved resilience\\nof territorial space in the face of climate change. We have encouraged each provinces\\n(autonomous regions, municipalities) to coordinated and promoted relevant departments and\\nlocal governments to strengthen climate change adaptation strategies, further incorporating\\nthese strategies into territorial space planning at all levels. We have established a national\\nurban health check and evaluation system for land space planning, incorporating an annual\\nreview and a five-year assessment cycle. Cities nationwide will routinely monitor low-carbon\\nresilience indicators.\\n[40] The term “Three Zones” refers to the three types of land spaces: urban, agricultural, and ecological spaces.\\nThe “Three Lines” refer to arable land and permanent basic farmland, ecological conservation redlines, and\\nurban development boundaries.\\nPart III Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation\\n160\\nWe optimized the regional layout of disaster prevention, reduction, and relief resources. We\\nhave also coordinated the flood control efforts for the mainstreams and tributaries, upstream\\nand downstream areas, both sides of riverbanks, as well as in urban areas. We have also\\naddressed the needs of coastal cities for typhoon and moisture prevention, scientifically\\ndelineated flood risk control areas, clarified comprehensive natural disaster risk prevention\\nand control areas, optimized the layout of flood risk prevention and control facilities, and\\nimproved the ability to respond to extreme weather and natural disasters.\\n\\n We have strengthened assessment of climate change impacts and risks in key\\nregions such as the Yangtze River Economic Belt, Yellow River Basin, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei,\\nand Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and organized provinces to regularly release climate change\\nmonitoring bulletins. We have organized regional climate change technology and work\\nexchanges, issued and implemented the Technical Guidelines for Planning Environmental\\nImpact Assessment - Comprehensive Planning of Watersheds, encouraging a focus on\\npotential risks faced by watersheds in the context of climate change in watershed\\ncomprehensive planning and environmental assessment, and proposing measures to adaption\\nto climate change.\\n We have strengthened the\\nconstruction of climate change monitoring stations and networks in the plateau climate\\nsystem. We selected the Lhasa River Basin in the upper reaches of the Yajiang River, and\\nbuilt a scientific research demonstration platform for the integrated protection and systematic\\nmanagement of mountains, rivers, forests, farmlands, lakes, grasslands, and deserts, and\\ncarried out comprehensive observation, warning, and management of changes in the Earth\\'s\\nsystem at multiple levels. A carbon flux monitoring network for typical high-altitude\\necosystems in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has been preliminarily established, and a gradient\\nconnected peak (Mount Everest) meteorological observation station has been established. A\\nprediction system for the impact of climate change on the ecosystem, climate system, water\\nresources, rare and endangered or unique wildlife and plants, snow-capped mountains,\\nglaciers, permafrost, and natural disasters in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has been established,\\nand ecological risk reporting and warning mechanisms have been improved. We conducted\\nresearch on the impact of climate change on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and established an\\ninter-ministerial coordination mechanism for ecological environment protection and climate\\nchange adaptation on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. We convened a cross departmental exchange\\nmeeting on climate change work on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and strengthened the\\nconstruction of cross departmental, multi sphere, and comprehensive observation and\\nresearch capabilities on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.\\n We have carried out water source\\nconservation forests, soil and water conservation forest construction projects, as well as land\\ncomprehensive improvement projects in the Yellow River Basin. Also, we carried out key\\nwater source conservation area fencing and protection measures. We implemented the\\n\\'\\'Yellow River Basin Adaptation Plan to Enhance Climate Resilience\\'\\' technical assistance\\nproject, and developed an action plan for climate change adaption in the Yellow River Basin.\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n161\\nWe organized experts to systematically compile fundamental geographic, environmental, and\\nclimate data pertaining to the Yellow River Basin, analyzed the present-day impact of climate\\nchange on the Yellow River Basin, projected future climate change scenarios, and assessed\\nclimate risks in key areas such as water resources and ecosystems. In the Yangtze River Basin,\\nintegrate protection and restoration of water environments, water habitats, water resources,\\nand water ecosystems. Advance flood protection projects along the Yangtze’s main dikes and\\npromote eco-friendly transformations to enhance ecosystem integrity, diversity, stability, and\\nsustainability. Strengthen water ecological protection and restoration in the Yangtze River\\nBasin and special water environment treatment at the estuaries of major tributaries entering\\nthe Yangtze. Ensure the biological and ecological safety of the basin, creating a “green\\necological corridor” in the Yangtze River Basin and establishing a model of harmonious\\ncoexistence between humans and nature.\\n\\nIn August 2022, the Guidelines for the Formulation of Provincial Adaptation to Climate\\nChange Action Plans was issued to provide guidance and criteria for the formulation of\\nprovincial-level action plans to adapt to climate change. These guidelines aimed to enhance\\nthe efforts of provincial-level administrative regions in adapting to climate change. Led by\\ntheir respective Department (or Bureau) of Ecology and Environment, all provinces,\\nautonomous regions, and municipalities actively drafted provincial action plans for climate\\nchange adaptation. Most provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities established\\nleading groups (coordinating groups, working groups, task teams) and technical support\\nteams to formulate these plans. They also instituted working mechanisms led by the ecology\\nand environment department, with support from relevant departments and professional teams.\\nEach province, autonomous region and municipality has promoted interdepartmental\\ncoordination, clarified roles and responsibilities, and jointly issued provincial climate\\nadaptation action plans, with the ecological environment department coordinating with local\\ndevelopment and reform, science and technology, finance, natural resources, housing and\\nurban-rural development, transportation, water resources, agriculture, culture and tourism,\\nhealth, emergency management, People’s Bank of China provincial (district, municipal)\\nbranches, Chinese Academy of Sciences field offices, meteorology, energy, forestry, and\\ngrassland, marine, and other departments. In the light of actual conditions, some provinces\\n(regions, cities) have also included defense, government services, animal husbandry,\\ncommunications, and local subsidiaries of the State Grid Corporation as co-issuers, covering\\nall key areas for climate adaptation work. Up to now, 29 provinces, autonomous regions, and\\nmunicipalities have officially issued their provincial action plans for adapting to climate\\nchange.\\n\\n\\n The integrated multi-sphere observation system for atmospheric, terrestrial,\\nmarine, and space climate systems is incomplete. The existing climate observation network\\nlacks coverage across all critical climate variables for a multi-sphere Earth system.\\nPart III Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation\\n162\\nCapabilities for seamless weather and climate monitoring, forecasting, and early warning are\\nlimited, and key technologies for forecasting major extreme events and compound disasters\\nare relatively underdeveloped. A systematic understanding of climate impacts on water, food\\nand agriculture, disaster reduction, human health, energy, transportation, and the environment\\nis lacking, with limited interdisciplinary and joint research across sectors. There is also a need\\nfor a unified, efficient service platform to support these areas.\\n Basic capabilities in the sector of\\nwater resources for climate adaptability need to be improved, and the working system for\\nclimate adaptation was far from perfect. The disaster early warning, prevention, and control\\ncapabilities of terrestrial ecosystems urgently need to enhance, and the monitoring and\\nassessment system for key ecological functional zones, sensitive and vulnerable areas,\\necological protection redlines, and high-risk areas need to be strengthened. The layout of\\nmarine environment monitoring stations lacks optimal design, and disaster forecasting\\naccuracy needs improvement. Effective measures are still lacking for addressing risks such as\\nocean acidification and biodiversity loss.\\n Agricultural infrastructure is\\nnot yet perfect, and management and support systems for agricultural adaptation are\\nunderdeveloped. Health risk assessments and adaptability evaluations are insufficient, and\\nthere is a need to improve the climate adaptability of vulnerable populations, evaluate the\\neffectiveness of adaptation measures, and strengthen mechanisms for public health benefit\\nassessment and cooperation. Existing infrastructure does not yet meet climate adaptation\\nneeds. Urban lifeline systems still lack stability and resilience in response to extreme weather\\nand climate events. Some urban public facilities and rural water management facilities are\\noutdated, and the comprehensive flood control and disaster reduction system is not perfect.\\nClimate-related data in the financial sector is insufficient, and energy infrastructure lacks\\nadequate resilience to adverse climate impacts.

This\\nmechanism focuses on assessing climate change impacts on vulnerable regions, the effects of\\nglobal climate change on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and climate risk assessment frameworks,\\nas well as enhancing climate-adaptive city construction pilots.\\nTo ensure the compilation of provincial climate adaptation action plans, each provincial\\nDepartment of Ecology and Environment has formed a leading group (or coordination group,\\nworking group, dedicated working team) with technical support, creating a framework led by\\nenvironmental authorities with support from relevant departments and professional teams. As\\nof now, 29 provincial (district, municipal)-level climate adaptation action plans have been\\nofficially issued.\\n\\n\\nChina is undergoing rapid industrialization and urbanization, and to minimize adverse\\nimpacts and risks of climate change, the country seeks to enhance urban climate adaptation\\ncapacity and ensure safe city operations. In 2017, China selected 28 cities (districts/counties)\\nto initiate climate-resilient urban pilot projects. Pilot cities are actively exploring ways to\\nadapt, spreading\\nadaptation concepts, innovating work mechanisms, and\\nenhancing\\nadaptation actions in key areas, building a foundation for improving urban climate resilience.\\nTo enhance systemic governance of urban climate risks and to comprehensively improve\\ncities’ adaptability to climate change, while building green, livable, safe, and resilient cities,\\nChina has summarized and evaluated the construction conditions, outcomes, and lessons of\\npilot cities. The country explores methods and pathways for advancing the pilot work,\\ndevelops the Pilot Scheme for Deepening Climate-Resilient Urban Construction, and clarifies\\npilot construction ideas and key tasks.

This involves conducting surveys and\\nassessments of climate ecological resources to understand their baseline, preparing detailed\\nzoning maps, enhancing business capabilities for climate ecological services, conducting risk\\nalerts and assessments for major meteorological disasters by disaster type, industry, region,\\nand time, and strengthening ecological safety meteorological support services. To realize the\\nPart III Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation\\n166\\nvalue of ecological products, China is establishing a quality evaluation and traceability\\nsystem for climate ecological products by region and category, adding value to climate\\necological products, building climate wellness demonstration bases, conducting value\\nassessments of climate ecological products, and promoting the application of results in local\\nplanning, key industry development, ecological protection compensation, and evaluations of\\necological civilization goals.\\n\\n\\nAs global warming intensifies, countries are increasingly concerned with climate adaptation,\\nprompting China to broaden and deepen its international cooperation on climate adaptation in\\nsuch a context of climate change and new international landscape. Through its partnership\\nwith the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA) and other international organizations, China has\\nstrengthened policy-sharing, practical cooperation, and experience-sharing in climate\\nadaptation. This includes discussions on climate risk assessment, resilient urban planning,\\nand mutual learning on effective practices and case studies, contributing China’s insights to\\nenhance global climate adaptability and promote joint resilience-building against climate\\nrisks worldwide.\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n167\\n\\n\\nIn 2020, China announced an updated and strengthened nationally determined contribution,\\naiming to achieve the world\\'s steepest dive in carbon intensity and to transition from carbon\\npeaking to carbon neutrality within the shortest period of time in history. This embodies\\nChina\\'s greatest effort to address global climate change based on its development stage and\\nnational circumstances. It also signifies high demand of finance, technology and capacity\\nbuilding in the near future. As a developing country with a population of 1.4 billion, China\\nfaces multiple challenges including economic development, people\\'s livelihood improvement,\\nenvironmental governance, and addressing climate change. Issues of unbalanced and\\ninadequate development remain significant, making the needs for finance, technology and\\ncapacity building extremely urgent.

More than RMB 2.5 trillion of green bonds were issued in China, including\\nRMB 490 billion in carbon-neutral bonds, dedicated to projects and areas with evident carbon\\nemission reduction and removal effects. As of June 2023, the first batch of 23 pilot cities and\\nregions for climate investment and financing had registered nearly 2,000 climate-friendly\\nprojects, involving funds close to RMB 2 trillion.\\n\\nAddressing climate change is a key area for fundamental research and technological\\ninnovation in China. Major national science and technology infrastructure projects, such as\\nthe \"Earth System Science Numerical Simulation Facility\", national technology innovation\\ncenters in the \"dual carbon\" fields such as fuel cells, green and low-carbon buildings, and\\nnew energy vehicles, national key R&D programs such as \"Renewable Energy Technologies\",\\nstrategic priority research programs such as \"Transformational Technologies for Clean\\nEnergy and Demonstration\", and the \"Nationally Promoted Low-carbon Technologies\\nCatalog\" serve as the primary methods through which China conducts scientific and\\ntechnological research and development, innovation and promotion to address climate change.\\n\\nSince the introduction of the \"dual carbon\" goals in 2020, China has continuously improved\\nits higher education talent development system for carbon peaking and carbon neutrality, as\\nwell as climate change-related courses and practical education systems in primary and\\nsecondary schools. It has introduced emerging professions related to addressing climate\\nchange, such as carbon emission managers, carbon management engineering technicians, and\\ncarbon sink measurement appraisers. Vocational skills training has been strengthened, and\\ncapacity building for government officials and enterprises in addressing climate change has\\nbeen enhanced. Through initiatives such as the \"National Energy Efficiency Promotion\\nWeek\", \"National Low-Carbon Day\", and \"World Environment Day\", public awareness and\\nknowledge dissemination has been strengthened, constantly improving the society-wide\\ncapacity to address climate change.\\n\\n\\n In order to compile the content related\\nto finance, technology and capacity building support for addressing climate change in the\\nNational Biennial Transparency Report, China has established a statistics and report\\npreparation mode, which is led by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment with\\ncoordination and collaboration from many ministries including the National Development\\nand Reform Commission, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Science and Technology,\\nMinistry of Finance, and China International Development Cooperation Agency, etc. It is also\\nsupported by local governments, relevant institutions and experts.\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n169\\n\\nChina has not yet established a systematic needs assessment and information reporting\\nsystem.

China faces challenges in fully, effectively and adequately\\nreporting its needs and support in finance, technology and capacity building. First, there is a\\nlack of a clear definition for climate finance, and the results of finance needs assessment and\\nfinance support statistics vary greatly depending on the methodologies chosen. Second, the\\nwide variety of technologies for addressing climate change makes it challenging to regularly\\nand timely update the progress on technology research and development, needs, and support.\\nThird, the broad scope and diverse forms of capacity building for addressing climate change\\nmakes it difficult to establish mechanisms for identifying and analyzing capacity building\\nneeds and support.

As a developing country, China needs to continually strengthen its efforts in climate\\nchange mitigation and adaptation to fulfill its nationally determined contributions.\\nContinuous, steady and large-scale financial input for addressing climate change is essential\\nfor advancing climate change mitigation and adaptation. China not only needs to fully\\nmobilize its own public and private investment, but also needs to seek international financial\\nsupport.\\n\\nThe Fourth National Communication on Climate Change of the People\\'s Republic of China,\\nsubmitted in December 2023, indicates that China\\'s annual average financial need for\\nmitigation actions is approximately RMB 2 trillion from 2021 to 2030. To achieve the carbon\\nneutrality goal, China is further intensifying its mitigation efforts, with an annual average\\nfinancial need of about RMB 6.5 trillion for mitigation actions from 2021 to 2060.\\nAdditionally, the annual average financial need for climate change adaptation is about RMB\\n1.6 trillion from 2021 to 2060. Considering both mitigation and adaptation actions, China\\'s\\ntotal financial need from the reporting year (2024) to 2030 is approximately RMB 25.2\\ntrillion, with an annual average of about RMB 3.6 trillion. The total financial need from the\\n2031 to 2060 is approximately RMB 243 trillion, with an annual average of about RMB 8.1\\ntrillion.\\n\\nThe period before 2030 is critical for China to achieve its carbon peaking goal. China will\\naccelerate the implementation of key carbon peaking tasks in the whole process and across all\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n175\\naspects of economic and social development. These tasks include actions for green and low-\\ncarbon energy transition, energy conservation, carbon emission reduction and efficiency\\nimprovement, carbon peaking in the industrial sector, carbon peaking in urban and rural\\nconstruction, green and low-carbon transportation, carbon emission reduction through a\\ncircular economy, green and low-carbon technological innovation, enhancing carbon sink\\ncapacity, nationwide green and low-carbon initiatives, and regional phased and orderly\\ncarbon peaking actions. During the same period, China will carry out comprehensive actions\\nfor climate change adaptation across various sectors and regions. This includes organizing\\nspecial initiatives to strengthen climate change monitoring, early warning, and risk\\nmanagement, improving climate change adaptation of natural ecosystems, enhancing climate\\nchange adaptation of socioeconomic systems, and establishing a regional framework for\\nclimate change adaptation.\\nBased on the current priorities for the mitigation and adaptation areas, some financial\\nrequirements are listed in Table 4-1.\\n\\n\\nFrom 2020 to 2022, China received a total of US$2.62 billion in international finance through\\nvarious channels, including the multilateral finance mechanism under the UNFCCC,\\nmultilateral development institutions and bilateral cooperation mechanisms, with an annual\\nper capita support amount of only US$0.62, equivalent to 0.6% of China\\'s own financial\\ninput in addressing climate change. The details of specific finance support projects are set\\nforth in Table 4-2.\\n China received US$141 million from the finance mechanism\\nunder the UNFCCC, US$407 million from bilateral channels with developed countries, and\\nUS$2.08 billion from multilateral development institutions. Multilateral development\\ninstitutions served as the primary channel for China to receive the climate finance support\\nduring the reporting period.\\n US$51 million was in the form of grants and\\nUS$2.57 billion in the form concessional loans. Concessional loans constituted the vast\\nmajority of climate finance support received by China during the reporting period.\\n Finance support for mitigation, adaptation and cross-\\ncutting sectors amounted to US$556 million , US$529 million and US$1.54 billion,\\nrespectively. Among these, the post-disaster recovery and reconstruction project for the\\nsevere rainstorm and flooding in Zhengzhou, Henan, received climate adaptation finance of\\nUS$528 million, while other adaptation projects received only US$937,000. Projects with\\nboth mitigation and adaptation objectives were the primary type of climate finance support\\nreceived by China during the reporting period.\\n\\n During the reporting period, China received a\\nPart IV Finance, Technology and Capacity Building Needs and Support Received\\n176\\ntotal finance of US$141 million through the finance mechanism under the UNFCCC. This\\nincluded grants of US$40.92 million from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and\\nconcessional loans of US$100 million from the Green Climate Fund (GCF). As mentioned\\nabove, to avoid double counting, these statistics exclude projects related to transparency\\ncompliance. Among these projects, finance for mitigation and cross-cutting sectors accounted\\nfor 87.9% and 12.1%, respectively, with no projects specifically targeted at adaptation. These\\nfunds primarily supported actions in sectors such as energy, agriculture and industry, as well\\nas multi-sectoral actions for biodiversity conservation and synergy in addressing climate\\nchange.\\n According to incomplete statistics, China received grants\\nworth US$9.13 million and concessional loans worth US$2.07 billion from multilateral\\ndevelopment banks during the reporting period. These funds mainly supported fields such as\\nagriculture, transportation, water resources and sanitation, as well as multi-sectoral actions.\\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) offered grants worth US$5.99 million and concessional\\nloans worth US$594 million, which funded actions in transportation, agriculture, industry,\\nurban and rural planning and development, climate financing, ecological protection, and\\ndisaster management; the World Bank (WB) offered grants worth US$3.14 million and\\nconcessional loans worth US$225 million, which funded agricultural management actions;\\nthe Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) offered concessional loans worth US$687\\nmillion to fund transportation and disaster risk management actions; the New Development\\nBank (NDB) offered concessional loans worth US$193 million to fund low-carbon\\ntransportation actions; the European Investment Bank (EIB) offered concessional loans worth\\nUS$367 million.\\n According to incomplete statistics, China received grants worth US$1.24\\nmillion and concessional loans worth US$406 million through bilateral channels during the\\nreporting period. These funds supported climate financing, ecological protection, near-zero\\nemission buildings, and multi-sectoral actions.\\n\\n In\\nrecent years, most of the climate finance support provided by developed countries to China\\nhas been in the form of loans. For grant projects, China often does not have control over the\\nfunds, with project operation and fund disbursement typically led by foreign institutions. As\\nmentioned above, China is still in a stage of low per capita income and uneven development.\\nIn pursuing its carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, China must simultaneously\\naddress\\nmultiple challenges,\\nincluding developing\\nits\\neconomy, improving\\npeople\\'s\\nlivelihoods and protecting its ecological environment. It still faces a significant financial gap\\nfor addressing climate change and requires support from the international community.\\n\\n\\n Developed countries often emphasize that\\nthe scale of worldwide climate investment and financing had hit US$1 trillion, and global\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n177\\ncapital should be fully mobilized. They try to confound their international obligations to\\nprovide climate finance to developing countries with the commercial behaviors in global\\ninvestment and financing. This can prejudice the lawful rights stipulated in the UNFCCC and\\nits Paris Agreement of developing countries including China.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChina is accelerating its transition from a coal-dominated energy structure to a green and\\nlow-carbon energy structure by vigorously deploying innovation and promotion of non-fossil\\nenergy technologies. While certain progress and experience have been gained in developing\\nclimate change mitigation technologies, there is still a need to strengthen technology\\ninnovation deployment and increase support to meet the vision for carbon peaking and carbon\\nneutrality. In the energy sector, key technology needs to include new solar photovoltaic\\nsystems, deep-sea and ultra-large offshore wind power, ocean power generation, efficient\\nbiomass conversion and utilization, advanced nuclear energy, new energy storage, hydrogen\\nenergy, and advanced smart grids. In the industrial and other sectors, key technology needs to\\ninclude low-carbon iron and steel smelting, low-carbon non-metallic mineral products, low-\\ncarbon chemicals, and new energy ships and aircraft. Additionally, carbon capture, utilization\\nand storage (CCUS), negative emission technologies, technologies for reducing non-CO2\\ngreenhouse gases such as methane, fluorinated gases and nitrous oxide, and green hydrogen\\nsynthesis of ammonia under mild conditions are also priority areas for technology\\ndevelopment and transfer support in China.\\n\\nChina\\'s vast territory and diverse climate make the cascading effects of climate change\\nevident, leading to an even more urgent need for the development of climate adaptation\\ntechnologies. Similar to other developing countries, China urgently needs to strengthen\\ntechnology development and transfer support in areas such as the monitoring and early\\nwarning of multiple natural disasters and compound cascading disasters caused by climate\\nchange, adaptive decision-making and risk prevention, agricultural water-saving irrigation,\\ncrop breeding for stress tolerance and pest control, protection and restoration of sensitive\\necosystems, integrated adaptation of marine and coastal zones, climate-resilient city\\nconstruction, and human health effects and adaptation.\\nSome current technology needs are listed in Table 4-3.\\n\\n\\nFrom 2020 to 2022, China received support for several new technology development and\\ntransfer projects through channels such as the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the\\nPart IV Finance, Technology and Capacity Building Needs and Support Received\\n178\\nGreen Climate Fund (GCF). In terms of content, project-related activities mainly focused on\\nthe\\nfeasibility\\nstudy\\nof\\ntechnologies,\\ncapacity\\nbuilding,\\npolicy\\nsupport\\nand\\npilot\\ndemonstration, with a lack of substantive transfer targeting key technology needs.\\nDetailed technology support projects are listed in Table 4-4.\\n\\n\\nChina Renewable Energy Scale-up Program Phase II (CRESP II), officially launched in 2013\\nand completed in 2022, is a phased project jointly implemented by the National Energy\\nAdministration, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), and the World Bank. Through a\\nthree-stage long-term cooperation plan, it aims at improving the economic efficiency of\\nrenewable energy development and utilization, accelerating the development of renewable\\nenergy power in China, and expediting the replacement of fossil fuels. In the context of the\\nsuccessful implementation and phased progress of CRESP I (2005-2012), China\\'s renewable\\nenergy power development has initially established robust legal and regulatory measures and\\ninstitutional arrangements. However, it still faces numerous technical and policy challenges,\\nincluding the imbalance between renewable energy resource endowment and consumption\\nload distribution, the mismatch between grid planning & construction and renewable energy\\ndevelopment & utilization, and the need to improve new power system markets suitable for\\nrenewable energy power participation. To this end, CRESP II aims to overcome some of the\\nkey barriers to renewable energy development in China, accelerate large-scale development\\nof renewable energy under a new investment landscape, control the costs of renewable energy\\npower, enhance renewable energy grid connection capacity and reduce energy curtailment.\\nCRESP II received grants of US$27.28 million, which funded five types of activities,\\nincluding renewable energy policy research, grid-connected consumption, technology\\ndevelopment, pilot demonstration, and capacity building. In terms of renewable energy power\\ntechnology development, key support was provided for the research on optimizing wind farm\\nlayout to reduce wake losses and maximize wind farm power output efficiency. For the grid\\nconnection scenarios of centralized renewable energy sources such as wind farms, the\\nfollowing activities were carried out: research on the integration of pumped storage and other\\nenergy storage technologies to address the intermittency and randomness of wind power\\noutput, enhance grid connection stability, and reduce curtailment rates; research on the layout\\nof current collection lines in large wind farms to achieve global cost optimization in cross-\\nregional line planning; design, development and demonstration of grid-friendly wind turbines\\nwith robust power control and fault management capabilities; research on large-scale grid\\nconnection simulation of wind power PV systems; support for international expert teams in\\nproviding training on solar thermal power generation engineering design to relevant\\ninstitutions, as well as in the design optimization of solar thermal power stations and the\\nresearch and development of key components and control systems. The project outcomes\\nsupported the formulation of national policies, such as the renewable energy development\\nplan and the renewable energy power consumption guarantee mechanism. The optimization\\nplans for the layout of large-scale onshore wind power bases have been applied to wind\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n179\\npower base construction in Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, and other regions. Methods for\\ncoordinated development and planning of renewable energy and grid infrastructure in the\\nnorthwest region have been promoted within the State Grid system, facilitating the large-\\nscale consumption of renewable energy. The project also contributed to the development of\\nmultiple national technical standards for offshore wind turbines and the benchmarking with\\ninternational engineering standards. It introduced planning, design and evaluation methods\\nfor DC grid integration systems suitable for the construction and development of offshore\\nwind farms in China, and supported the construction of the national offshore wind turbine\\ntesting center. According to estimates, the project implementation supported an annual\\nincrease in wind power generation of 1,024 GWh, replacing the consumption of 3 million\\ntons of standard coal and reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 9.16 million tons.\\n\\nOverall, the technology development and transfer support projects conducted by China have\\nplayed a positive role in providing reference to excellent international practices, optimizing\\nthe domestic policy framework and technology promotion environment, enhancing domestic\\nplanning, design and manufacturing capabilities, and conducting capacity-building training\\nfor technical personnel. However, there was a lack of substantive transfer targeting China\\'s\\nkey technology needs, resulting in limited improvement in the domestic technological\\ninnovation and development capacity. As a developing country, China actively participates in\\ninternational cooperation on climate technology development and transfer. However, in\\nrecent years, like many other developing countries, China still faces various challenges in\\nobtaining effective technology transfer and support.\\n\\n\\n In recent years, with the rise of anti-globalization and\\ngeneralization of national security concepts, developed countries tend to prioritize ensuring\\ndomestic supply chain security and industrial advantages, and their initiative in transferring\\nclimate friendly technologies to foreign countries has weakened. They have formulated trade\\nrestrictions or technology blockade policies in some areas. Some developed countries,\\nconcerned about the acquisition of advanced technologies by developing countries, have\\nintensified security review on foreign investment, therefore posing adverse impacts on the\\ntransfer of climate change response technologies to relevant industries (particularly to\\ndeveloping countries).\\n At\\npresent, most advanced climate technologies remain in the hands of private sectors in\\nindustrialized countries. In order to maximize profits and maintain technology monopoly\\nadvantages, the main foreign investment approach of multinational companies has evolved\\nfrom joint venture towards majority shareholding and sole proprietorship, or confine\\ntechnology transfers to their overseas branches within the scope of property and control rights,\\nthe essence of which is to block the transfer of relevant technologies to obtain technology\\nmonopoly value and secure market advantages in host countries.\\nPart IV Finance, Technology and Capacity Building Needs and Support Received\\n180\\n\\n As the implementing agency of the\\nTechnology Mechanism of the UNFCCC, the Climate Technology Centre and Network\\n(CTCN) serves as a crucial channel for responding to technology requests from developing\\ncountries and providing technical assistance. However, it has long faced challenges due to\\ninsufficient finance for its operation. The limited personnel, resources and capabilities of\\nNationally Designated Entities (NDEs) in developing countries also pose significant\\nconstraints. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects under the Kyoto Protocol\\ncontributed to climate technology development and transfer to a certain extent. However,\\nrelying on CDM projects has limited the scope of technology transfer, causing a need for\\nstronger measures or mechanisms to promote the transfer of relevant technologies to\\ndeveloping countries.\\n\\n Developing countries such as China have identified key areas and\\npriority technologies suited to their national circumstances through Technology Needs\\nAssessment (TNA). However, due to the lack of effective platforms and mechanisms for\\nsharing information about suitable advanced technology suppliers and relevant technical\\ninformation, it is difficult to match technology supply with demand, thus hindering\\ndeveloping countries from acquiring climate technologies. The technology framework under\\nthe Paris Agreement calls for the Technology Mechanism to take action in identifying and\\ndeveloping approaches, tools and means for the assessment of the technologies that are ready\\nto transfer, but no significant progress has been made.\\n\\n\\n\\nChina will be in need of more capacity-building support in the following areas:\\n\\n Reinforce the support of new-\\ngeneration information technology in climate change monitoring, impact assessment and\\nevaluation, establishing a climate change monitoring and evaluation system in a dynamic and\\nsystematic manner; conduct climate feasibility studies in national territorial spatial planning\\nand strengthen early warning and risk management of extreme climate events.\\n Improve the verification standards for carbon emission\\naccounting reports for regions, industries, enterprises and products, and establish a unified\\nand standardized carbon accounting system; establish a monitoring and accounting system for\\necosystem carbon sinks; strengthen capacity building in carbon emission statistics and\\naccounting, and build a carbon emission database, a national GHG emission factor database,\\nand a carbon emission monitoring and management platform to enhance the level of\\ninformation-based measurement.\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n181\\n\\n Establish and improve\\ncoordination and information sharing mechanisms for addressing climate change, and build a\\ncollaborative innovation work model featuring multi-sectoral coordination, multi-subject\\ncoordination, and mass participation.\\n Encourage local governments,\\nenterprises, social organizations and research institutions to integrate climate change\\nconsiderations into their organizational structures, business areas and work processes, thereby\\nenhancing their comprehensive decision-making and management capabilities in addressing\\nclimate change.\\n\\n Strengthen climate change education in schools, improve the climate\\nchange-related academic and professional systems in higher education institutions, and\\ncultivate innovative talents for addressing climate change.\\n Strengthen climate-related training for cadres and skills training for\\nprofessionals, and expand continuing education channels for addressing climate change.\\n Conduct science popularization activities on green, low-carbon, and climate-\\nadaptive measures, innovate climate change publicity means through multimedia and new\\nmedia channels, and develop public practice projects on addressing climate change.\\nSome of the current capacity-building needs are listed in Table 4-5.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom 2020 to 2022, the capacity-building support received by China focused on\\nimprovements in transparency compliance, enhancement in climate policy formulation\\ncapacity, talent development and cooperation. Projects related to capacity-building support\\nare all included in \"Table 4-2 Financial Support Received by China for Addressing Climate\\nChange\". According to the reporting guidelines, some typical capacity-building support\\nprojects are listed in Table 4-6.\\nThrough multilateral channels and with the support from GEF, China has successively\\nlaunched the Capacity Building for Enhanced Transparency Phase I and the Capacity-\\nbuilding Project for the Preparation of the Fourth National Communication and the Biennial\\nUpdate Reports on Climate Change, as detailed in Chapter 5 of this section. With the support\\nfrom the finance mechanism under the UNFCCC and multilateral development banks, China\\nhas carried out capacity-building activities across key sectors such as transportation, industry,\\nagriculture and forestry. These activities include improving the climate policy framework,\\norganizing pilot demonstration and innovation, and promoting the establishment of\\ncollaborative mechanisms.\\nPart IV Finance, Technology and Capacity Building Needs and Support Received\\n182\\nThe capacity-building support received by China from bilateral channels primarily consists of\\nresearch cooperation and specialized training. Some developed countries have signed\\nmemoranda of understanding with the Chinese government (including local governments),\\nuniversities and research institutions to establish joint research centers and scientific\\ncooperation projects, and carry out specialized training on capacity building for addressing\\nclimate change, covering topics such as synergy between pollution control and carbon\\nreduction, near-zero emission buildings, and climate prediction models. Capacity building\\ntakes the form of providing analytical tools, sharing successful experiences, and exchanging\\nexpertise.\\n\\n\\nChina and the EU have engaged in close cooperation on carbon market capacity building for many years.\\nFrom 2014 to 2017, China and the EU completed the EU-China Carbon Trading Capacity Building Project.\\nIn 2017, they launched the EU-China ETS Project, which has been extended into its second phase from\\n2021 to the present. The EU-China ETS Project, led by the European Commission\\'s Directorate-General\\nfor Climate Action and the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of the People\\'s Republic of China, aims\\nto continue supporting China in building a national carbon market through capacity-building activities.\\nThe capacity-building activities of this project include: regularly organizing carbon market policy\\ndialogues to enhance the understanding of Chinese policymakers and stakeholders on how carbon markets\\nsupport the implementation of the Paris Agreement goals; conducting capacity training for China\\'s carbon\\nmarket authorities and relevant enterprises to strengthen China\\'s ability to operate its national carbon\\nmarket; providing practical recommendations to China\\'s carbon market authorities through joint research,\\nfurther supporting the development of China\\'s carbon market and expanding new areas of EU-China\\ncooperation on carbon market-related topics.\\nFrom 2020 to 2022, a total of 44 carbon market capacity-building training sessions have been conducted\\nacross 18 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities), including Guangdong, Hainan, Ningxia,\\nJiangsu and Chongqing, with nearly 6,200 participants comprising local ecological and environmental\\nofficials and representatives from key emitting enterprises. These training sessions further enhanced local\\ndepartments\\' and enterprises\\' familiarity with carbon market construction and helped accumulate\\nknowledge and experience related to regional low-carbon development. The project also launched online\\ntraining for the power industry. The first training session introduced the latest policy requirements,\\nadvanced peer experience and case studies to 139 representatives from various power companies, to meet\\nthe need of power companies for improving their carbon market compliance capabilities. The project\\nincluded several joint studies, including study on information disclosure for national carbon market\\nregulation, industry benchmark study, and study on allocation methodologies for the national carbon\\nmarket quotas for promoting the achievement of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals. It organized\\nmultiple joint technical seminars covering topics such as carbon market launch preparations and risk\\ncontrol, key issues in the construction and development of China\\'s carbon market, and emission factor\\nvalues for enterprise GHG emission accounting. The project also supported the third EU-China Ministerial\\nCarbon Emissions Trading Policy Dialogue, where both sides exchanged views on the latest progress in\\ncarbon emissions trading and future EU-China cooperation in this area.\\nOverall, the EU-China ETS Project has achieved remarkable results in advancing the construction of\\nChina\\'s national carbon market. It has enhanced the understanding and participation of Chinese\\ngovernment authorities at various levels and key emitting enterprises regarding carbon market operation,\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n183\\nprovided technical research support for the design of China\\'s carbon market, and laid a solid foundation for\\nthe\\nconti\\nnued deepening of EU-China cooperation in carbon markets.\\n\\n\\n Compared with financial and technical support, most capacity-\\nbuilding efforts lack evaluation methods to measure their effectiveness, making it difficult to\\nidentify areas and methods for improvement. This includes areas such as enhancing\\ncompliance capacity, refining policy development, establishing coordination mechanisms,\\nand raising public awareness.\\n\\n Although developing countries such as China have\\nidentified their capacity-building needs for addressing climate change through Nationally\\nDetermined Contributions, National Communications, Biennial Update Reports, Biennial\\nTransparency\\nReports,\\nAdaptation\\nCommunication,\\nNational\\nAdaptation\\nPlans,\\nand\\nTechnology Needs Assessments, a comprehensive, transparent and open information platform\\nfor capacity-building resource supply and a matching mechanism have yet to be established.\\nAs a result, developing countries face difficulties in acquiring timely and effective capacity-\\nbuilding support, including climate finance support and technology support related to\\ncapacity-building.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Chinese government attaches great importance to compliance under the UNFCCC. The\\nMinistry of Ecology and Environment has gradually established a stable technical support\\nteam for compliance under the UNFCCC and organized experts involved in the negotiation of\\ntransparency compliance rules to conduct multiple capacity-building training sessions and\\nseminars targeting relevant industry authorities and compliance report authors. However, in\\nterms of implementing the new requirements of the \"modalities, procedures and guidelines\"\\nfor the enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement, China still faces the\\nfollowing difficulties and challenges in compliance.\\nIn terms of inventory preparation, it is necessary to further establish and improve the data\\ncollection and statistics mechanism, strengthen the capacity for measurement and analysis of\\nlocalized GHG emission/removal factors, develop and improve the database management\\nplatform, and enhance data quality control and assurance functions of the database.\\nIn terms of reporting progress in nationally determined contributions and mitigation\\neffectiveness evaluation actions, it is necessary to research and develop methodologies for\\nrapid carbon emissions accounting and forecasting, create methodologies for disaggregating\\nPart IV Finance, Technology and Capacity Building Needs and Support Received\\n184\\nemission reductions to avoid double counting of mitigation effects, improve the capacity to\\nidentify and apply methodologies for quantifying effectiveness, enhance the capacity to\\nevaluate the implementation effect of the \"1+N\" policy system for carbon peaking and carbon\\nneutrality, and strengthen the assessment of the synergies of NDCs.\\nIn terms of adaptation, it is necessary to research and establish a reporting mechanism for\\nclimate change impacts and adaptation, enhance the capacity to analyze the climate change\\ncharacteristics and develop future climate change scenarios, improve the capacity to analyze\\nclimate change impacts, risks and vulnerabilities, strengthen the capacity to identify climate\\nchange adaptation goals, priorities, and the challenges or barriers faced, and improve the\\ncapacity to monitor, evaluate and report the progress on adaptation policies.\\nIn terms of reporting the finance, technology and capacity-building support needed and\\nreceived, it is necessary to develop cost-benefit analysis methodologies for calculating the\\nneeds of each sector and/or each type of mitigation action, explore the establishment of a\\nbottom-up centralized statistical mechanism and data reporting platform for receiving\\ninformation on the finance, technology and capacity-building support activities.\\nBased on the above needs, preliminary analysis indicates that from 2024 to 2030, China\\'s\\nfinancial need to enhance compliance transparency could reach tens of millions of US dollars\\nannually. Some of the financial needs are listed in Table 4-7.\\nFor example, in the measurement and analysis of the national GHG inventory as well as the\\ndevelopment, construction, operation and maintenance of the database system, an average\\nannual expenditure of approximately US$18 million and US$0.9 million, respectively, will be\\nrequired over the next five years. The specific calculation details are provided in Box 4-3.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBased on the specific requirements for preparing an inventory covering seven types of greenhouse gases\\nfrom five major sectors - energy, industrial processes, agriculture, land use, land-use change and forestry\\n(LULUCF), and waste, activities include matching with relevant activity level data, factor investigation,\\nmonitoring, measurement and analysis. The budget amounts for these activities are US$5.5 million/year,\\nUS$2.5 million/year, US$4.5 million/year, US$3 million/year and US$2.5 million/year, respectively,\\ntotaling US$18 million/year. In this process, there is also a need for technology and capacity-building\\nsupport for the measurement and analysis of emission factors.\\n\\n\\nA high-quality compliance-related database will encompass core modules covering the national GHG\\ninventory, NDC progress and related policy measures, climate change adaptation policies and vulnerability\\nassessments, finance, technology and capacity-building support, as well as support modules for\\ninternational expert panel review and multilateral review processes.

In 2020 and 2021, GHG\\nemissions (without LULUCF) from Energy accounted for 83.74% and 84.78%, followed by\\nWaste (11.05% and 10.41%), IPPU (5.12% and 4.73%), and Agriculture (0.09% and 0.08%)\\n(See Figures 5-1 and 5-2).\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n239\\n\\n\\nThe GHG emissions in HKSAR are primarily CO2. In 2020 and 2021, CO2 emissions\\naccounted for 84.33% and 85.02%, followed by CH4 (10.88% and 10.27%), F-gases\\n(3.47% and 3.42%), and N2O (1.32% and 1.29%) in terms of CO2eq (see Figures 5-3 and 5-\\n4).\\n\\nPart V Information of HKSAR on Climate Change\\n240\\n\\nIn 2020 and 2021, HKSAR’s GHG emissions from special regional and international\\nbunkers (aviation and maritime) amounted to about 31,098.5 ktCO2eq and 27,874.6\\nktCO2eq, including about 10,629.2 ktCO2eq and 9,457.3 ktCO2eq from special regional\\nmaritime and aviation, and about 20,469.2 ktCO2eq and 18,417.3 ktCO2eq from\\ninternational maritime and aviation. These emissions were listed separately as memo items\\nand not accounted into HKSAR’s total emissions.\\n\\nBased on the analysis conducted in accordance with the propagation of error stated in the\\n2006 IPCC Guidelines, the overall uncertainties of HKSAR\\'s GHG inventories for 2005,\\n2020, and 2021 were about 4.22%, 5.99%, and 5.78% respectively. The results of the\\nuncertainty analysis for each sector were reported under each sector.\\n\\nHKSAR has been importing nuclear energy from the Chinese mainland since 1994, which\\naccounted for around a quarter of HKSAR\\'s fuel mix for electricity generation in 2022.\\nSince 1997, HKSAR has stopped building coal-fired electricity generation units. The share\\nof coal in the overall fuel mix for electricity generation in HKSAR has decreased from\\nabout half in 2015 to about a quarter currently, while the share of natural gas has\\nsignificantly increased from about a quarter in 2015 to about half currently. Furthermore,\\nbuildings account for 90% of the total electricity consumption in HKSAR, i.e., over 50% of\\nthe total GHG emissions. Through coordinated efforts in improving the energy efficiency\\nstandards of buildings, carrying out energy saving and emission reduction, as well as\\nadjusting the fuel mix for electricity generation, GHG emissions from the energy industry\\nin 2021 were reduced by about 24% compared to 2005.\\nHKSAR has continued to reduce emissions from transport by expanding “green transport”\\nsuch as public transport networks, promoting electric vehicle, and developing new energy\\ntransport solutions. With the advancement of emission reduction technologies, GHG\\nemissions from the transport sector in 2021 were decreased by about 13% compared to\\n2005.\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n241\\nHKSAR\\'s GHG emissions peaked in 2014 and shows a downward trend since then.\\nHKSAR\\'s total GHG emissions in 2022 were decreased by about 19% and 24% compared\\nto the 2005 and 2014 respectively. In 2022, the per capita GHG emissions were about 4.73\\ntCO2eq, a reduction of around 25% compared to both 2005 and 2014.\\nImplementing the four major decarbonization strategies outlined in the \"Hong Kong’s\\nClimate Action Plan 2050\" - \"Net-zero Electricity Generation\", \"Energy Saving and Green\\nBuildings\", \"Green Transport\", and \"Waste Reduction\" - is a crucial step towards achieving\\ncarbon neutrality in HKSAR by 2050[48]. GHG emissions from the energy industry (power\\ngeneration and Towngas production) and transport account for about 80% of HKSAR\\'s\\ntotal. As electric vehicles become more popular, GHG emissions from transport are\\nexpected to decrease in the future. The popularization of electric vehicles and the growing\\ndemand for charging are expected to increase the demand for electricity supply. However,\\ndue to the HKSAR\\'s focus on promoting \"Net-zero Electricity Generation\" and \"Energy\\nSaving and Green Buildings\" strategies, even if the widespread adoption of electric\\nvehicles is expected to increase the demand for electricity supply, it will not change the\\noverall downward trend in GHG emissions.\\nAs for the Waste sector, over 90% of CH4 emissions in HKSAR are sourced from the long-\\nterm decomposition of MSW in landfills. The \"Waste Reduction\" strategy advocates waste\\nreduction and recycling to reduce overall waste volume. HKSAR is committed to develop\\nsufficient waste-to-energy facilities by 2035 or earlier, in order to move away from the\\ncurrent reliance on landfills for MSW disposal. As landfill gas recovery capabilities\\ncontinue to improve and waste-to-energy facilities are gradually put into operation, it is\\nexpected to both reduce CH4 emissions and increase the supply of renewable energy.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Inventory of Energy mainly covers CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions from fossil fuel\\nburning in the energy industry, manufacturing and construction industries, transport and\\nother sectors, as well as fugitive CH4 emissions from oil and natural gas systems.\\n\\nThe calculation of emissions from Energy in HKSAR was mainly based on the 2006 IPCC\\nGuidelines. Tier 3 method was used for CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions from electricity\\ngeneration. Tier 2 method was used for CO2 emissions while Tier 1 method was used for\\nCH4 and N2O emissions from Towngas production. Tier 2 method was used for CO2\\nemissions while Tier 1 method was used for CH4 and N2O emissions in utilizing landfill\\ngas for energy purposes.

To avoid double-counting\\nacross different sectors, the HKSAR Government has adopted the following data\\nrefinement and emission source classification measures in processing the annual activity\\nraw data and emissions data in the above-mentioned sectors.\\nIn the cement production process, GHG emissions are sourced from the use of silicate\\ncement clinker and the consumption of fossil fuels (mainly coal and oil). Based on the\\nannual raw data of fossil fuel consumption and use of silicate cement clinker provided by\\ncement producers, GHG emissions from fossil fuel consumption and the use of silicate\\ncement clinker were calculated respectively. According to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, GHG\\nemissions from fossil fuel consumption were classified as \"fuel consumption\" under\\nEnergy sector while those from the use of silicate cement clinker were classified as the\\n\"cement production\" under IPPU.\\nRegarding waste-to-energy facilities, HKSAR mainly relies on sludge incineration and\\nconverting food waste into biogas for electricity generation. Based on annual data collected\\nfrom waste-to-energy facilities, GHG emissions from electricity generation were reported\\nunder the \"energy industry (electricity generation and gas production)\" of Energy sector in\\naccordance with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.\\nIn addition, the landfill gas produced by MSW disposal at landfills utilized for electricity\\ngeneration and Towngas production[49]. Based on annual MSW disposal and landfill gas\\nrecovery statistics collected from landfills, GHG emissions from MSW disposal were\\ncalculated according to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and put under MSW disposal under\\nWaste sector after deducting the volume of landfill gas recovered. On the other hand, GHG\\n[49] For details, see Chapter 2, Section 4, on “Strengthening Control of Non-CO₂ GHG emissions.”\\nPart V Information of HKSAR on Climate Change\\n248\\nemissions from electricity generation and Towngas production by utilizing landfill gas were\\nincluded in the \"energy industry (electricity generation and gas production)\" under Energy\\nsector in accordance with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.\\n\\nThe HKSAR Government has put effort in strengthening the QA/QC work during the\\ncompilation of GHG inventory. Measures to improve the quality of inventory compilation\\nhave been carried out, including:\\nFirst, the 2006 IPCC Guidelines was strictly followed to ensure the scientific rigor,\\ncomparability, and transparency in inventory compilation.\\nSecond, based on the data availability, higher-tier methods were used where possible to\\nensure the accuracy of the inventory results.\\nThird, during activity data collection and analysis, the inventory compilation team has\\nworked closely with relevant departments to obtain authoritative first-hand official data.\\nDesignated officer has been arranged for GHG inventory management, verification, and\\ninspection in order to ensure the authority and reasonableness of the data used.\\nFourth, while determining the emission factors, those suitable for HKSAR\\'s actual\\nconditions were adopted where possible. In case of no emission factors reflecting HKSAR\\'s\\ncharacteristics, the default emission factors provided in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines were\\nused to ensure the accuracy of the inventory results.\\nThe measures taken to reduce uncertainty mainly include the following two aspects: The\\nfirst is to improve the data collection work. Official published statistical data, and local\\nmeasured emission factors and parameters were used and refer to the latest relevant\\nparameters in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. The second is to select appropriate methodologies.\\nBased on the data availability, higher-tier methods were adopted in emissions calculations.\\nWhen there are significant changes in the key categories and the calculation methods of\\ninventory, as well as major revisions to the data of individual categories, the HKSAR\\nGovernment would examine the impact of such changes or revisions on every inventory\\nyears, and adopt a harmonized method for the every inventory years as far as possible\\nbased on data availability so as to ensure the time-series consistency and comparability of\\nthe inventory. To ensure the traceability and completeness of the records, all changes or\\nrevisions to the inventory (including the reasons, revision methods, etc.) would be recorded\\nin detail. Original calculation data would be retained for future reference.\\nAs part of the inventory quality assurance, the HKSAR Government would cross-check the\\ndata related to GHG emissions (such as electricity sent-out, energy consumption, vehicle\\nmileage, etc.) with other agencies/departments. By comparing the differences between\\nvarious data, the uncertainty of the data can be reduced, thereby improving the accuracy of\\nGHG emission calculations. Furthermore, the HKSAR Government would review inviting\\na non-inventory team as a third independent party to review the inventory.\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n249\\n\\n\\n\\nGHG emissions from road transport were calculated based on the vehicle mileage and fuel\\nconsumption data obtained through modeling, which accounted for about 16% of HKSAR\\'s\\ntotal GHG emissions in 2022. To enhance the accuracy of the inventory, the HKSAR\\nGovernment has improved the methodology for estimating GHG emissions from road\\ntransport by using the annual raw data on vehicle mileage, fuel economy and model\\nprojection data to calculate GHG emissions. Furthermore, the HKSAR Government\\ncompared annual vehicle fuel sales data with the vehicle mileage data and estimated GHG\\nemissions data. Through comparison of differences between various data, the uncertainty in\\ndata can be reduced, and the accuracy of GHG emission calculations can be improved.\\n\\nAnnual GHG emissions from HFCs in HKSAR were estimated using imports and exports\\nstatistics of refrigerants and related industry-wide surveys on the usage of refrigerants.\\nGiven that HKSAR will fulfill the provisions of the Kigali Amendment regarding the\\ngradual phase-down of the local production and use of 18 types of HFCs, in order to\\nimprove the accuracy and comprehensiveness of calculating the usage and emissions of\\nHFCs, the HKSAR Government will stay up-to-date and consider optimizing the survey\\ncontent on refrigerant usage, including the usage of low-GWP refrigerants[50] and\\nincorporating low-GWP refrigerants into the inventory calculations, in preparation for\\nfuture development in HFC emission reductions. This can accurately reflect the GHG\\nemissions caused by refrigerant use, and lay a foundation for accurately estimating and\\npredicting GHG emissions and trends from HFCs, thus improving the effectiveness of the\\nHKSAR Government\\'s monitoring policies.\\n\\nThe HKSAR Government will review the classification of fuel combustion activities (other\\nthan electricity generation and transport) under Energy. GHG emissions from fuel\\ncombustion in the residential, commercial and industrial sectors will be clearly\\ndistinguished by comparing more detailed annual energy statistics data with the 2006 IPCC\\nGuidelines. The inventory improvement will make the refined GHG emission data more\\nrepresentative and will also help the HKSAR Government to further analyze and\\nunderstand the GHG emissions from fuel combustion in HKSAR.\\n[50] Alongside the global commitment to combating climate change and the adoption of the Kigali Amendment,\\nrefrigerant manufacturers have developed more and more low-GWP refrigerants that can serve as alternatives to\\nHFCs refrigerants. At present, different types of such alternatives are available in the global market and many of\\nthem have already been introduced to the Hong Kong market, such as R1233zd and R514A for water-cooled\\nchillers, R600a for household refrigerators, and R1234yf for automotive air conditioners Their GWP values are\\nbelow 5.\\nPart V Information of HKSAR on Climate Change\\n250\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Chief Executive is the head of the HKSAR, who is responsible for making decisions\\non government policies and issuing Executive Orders, and is assisted in policy making by\\nthe Executive Council.

HKSAR\\'s electricity\\nconsumption is mainly from local thermal power and primarily supplemented by nuclear\\nenergy imported from the Guangdong Province. In the annual electricity consumption of\\nthe HKSAR in 2022, coal accounted for around 25%, natural gas accounted for around\\n48%, and renewable energy and nuclear energy accounted for around 27%.\\nHKSAR has a well-developed public transport system. The public transport comprises\\nrailways, tramways, buses, minibuses, taxis and ferries. The public transport system on\\naverage carried 9.67 million passenger trips daily in 2022. This represented nearly 90% of\\nthe daily number of passenger trips. By the end of 2022, there were around 810,000\\nlicensed motor vehicles in HKSAR, with around 571,000 of them being private cars. The\\nmotor vehicle and private car ownership were 126 and 88 per 1,000 people respectively.\\nHong Kong is a highly urbanized, service-oriented city with limited energy-intensive\\nindustries. Most of its energy consumption is used for electricity generation (90% of which\\nis consumed by buildings), followed by transportation. As a result, electricity generation,\\ntransportation and waste are the three major sources of GHG emissions in the HKSAR,\\ncollectively accounting for around 90% of total emissions. The HKSAR\\'s decarbonization\\nefforts primarily focus on these three critical areas to formulate overall decarbonization\\nstrategies accordingly.\\n\\nHKSAR is located in the southern part of China, bordering Shenzhen City of Guangdong\\nProvince in the north and surrounded by sea on three sides. As of 2022, HKSAR has a land\\narea of 1,113.76 km2 comprising Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, the New Territories and the\\nIslands. With hilly terrain, nearly 300 km2 of land has been developed for living and\\neconomic activities. More than 500 km2 of land has been designated for nature\\nconservation, including country parks and other conservation-related areas. HKSAR is\\nlocated within the sub-tropical region with a mild climate. The average annual mean\\ntemperature was 23.6°C and the average annual rainfall was about 2,438 mm for the past\\n30 years (1993-2022). Extreme weather conditions that occur in HKSAR include tropical\\ncyclones, strong monsoon, monsoon troughs and severe convective weather. Sub-tropical\\nevergreen broad-leaved forest is the main vegetation in HKSAR. HKSAR has a rich\\nbiodiversity of marine species such as fish and crustaceans. However, fresh water resource\\nis relatively scarce.

To\\nalign with the NDC target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, the Chief Executive of\\nHKSAR announced in the 2020 Policy Address that HKSAR would strive to achieve\\ncarbon neutrality before 2050. Subsequently, the \"Hong Kong\\'s Climate Action Plan 2050\"\\nwas released in 2021, setting more ambitious carbon reduction strategies and measures,\\nstrengthening the interim target, and aiming to halve Hong Kong\\'s carbon emissions before\\n2035 as compared with the 2005 level. Focusing on the three major GHG emission sources,\\nnamely power generation, transport and waste, the Plan sets out four major decarbonization\\nstrategies, i.e. \"net-zero electricity generation\", \"energy saving and green buildings\", \"green\\ntransport\" and \"waste reduction\"[55], to lead Hong Kong towards carbon neutrality.\\n\\nHKSAR has been importing nuclear energy from the Chinese Mainland since 1994, which\\naccounted for around a quarter of HKSAR\\'s fuel mix for electricity generation in 2022.

The HKSAR Government, together with power companies, will\\nPart V Information of HKSAR on Climate Change\\n254\\nexplore ways to enhance regional cooperation on zero-carbon energy, and collaborate with\\nneighboring regions to explore additional zero-carbon energy supply, including seeking\\njoint ventures and joint development opportunities for participating in and operating zero-\\ncarbon energy projects near Hong Kong. In addition, the HKSAR Government has reserved\\nland to build electricity facilities, which will connect to the electricity supply systems of the\\npower companies to strengthen their interconnection and the ability of electricity\\ntransmission. The project is currently still in the planning stage, and it is estimated to take\\naround 10 years to plan, construct and complete the new cross-boundary electricity\\ntransmission and receiving facilities. They are expected to be commissioned before 2035,\\nand the share of imported zero-carbon energy electricity may have a further increase by\\nthen.\\nIn terms of building energy efficiency, HKSAR faces the challenge of aging buildings.\\nSome buildings were not designed with energy efficiency in mind, and their electrical\\nsystems may not be easily upgraded to accommodate new energy-saving devices. To this\\nend, the HKSAR Government is actively promoting retro-commissioning. This involves\\nregular inspection, adjustment, correction and repair of existing control/monitoring systems\\nin existing buildings. This initiative aims to continuously improve the energy efficiency of\\nbuilding installations and reduce energy consumption.\\nIn 2022, HKSAR disposed of municipal solid waste totaling 4.06 million tonnes, an\\naverage of 11,128 tonnes per day. To monitor the latest trend in waste disposal and\\nrecycling, the HKSAR Government collects data from various sources, including records\\nfrom waste treatment facilities of the HKSAR Government, statistical surveys from\\ndifferent recyclers to gather data on the quantities of various materials recycled, and\\nsampling at waste treatment facilities to analyze the waste components and collect data on\\nthe disposal quantities of various waste materials in municipal solid waste. The HKSAR\\nGovernment consolidates and processes the above data to compile statistics on recycling\\nand disposal quantities categorized by waste type and publish them in the publicly available\\nsolid waste monitoring report annually.\\nIn promoting green transport, it is essential to put in place a comprehensive electric vehicle\\ncharging network to support the popularization of electric vehicles. As the technologies of\\nelectric vehicle batteries and quick chargers are advancing and the electric vehicle market\\nenvironment is evolving, the HKSAR Government will continue to keep in view the\\nrelevant technological developments, and expand the charging network as well as the\\nassociated supporting facilities on various fronts, with a view to providing drivers with the\\nnecessary electric vehicle charging services. Additionally, it will use the traffic data from\\nthe Transport Department to track the number of new energy vehicles and assess the\\nprogress in the implementation of relevant policies.\\n\\n\\nIn order to effectively control the GHG emissions, the HKSAR Government released the\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n255\\n\"Hong Kong\\'s Climate Action Plan 2050\" in 2021. Focusing on the three major local GHG\\nemission sources, namely power generation, transport and waste, the HKSAR Government\\nsets out four major decarbonization strategies, i.e. \"net-zero electricity generation\", \"energy\\nsaving and green buildings\", \"green transport\" and \"waste reduction\", and formulates\\nrelevant policies and actions to effectively mitigate climate change.\\n\\nNet-zero electricity generation. The HKSAR Government has set a target to cease the use\\nof coal for daily electricity generation by 2035, and replace coal-fired electricity generation\\nwith natural gas with lower carbon emissions and zero-carbon energy. The HKSAR\\nGovernment needs to increase the share of zero-carbon energy in the fuel mix for electricity\\ngeneration to 60%~70% before 2035, increase the share of renewable energy to 7.5%~10%\\nand further increase it to 15% subsequently, and achieve the medium-term target of\\nreducing carbon emissions by half from the 2005 level before 2035. To this end, since 1997,\\nHKSAR has ceased to build coal-fired electricity generation units. Currently, the share of\\ncoal in the fuel mix for electricity generation has been reduced from around half in 2015 to\\naround a quarter, while the share of natural gas has significantly increased from around a\\nquarter in 2015 to almost half. The HKSAR Government will take into account the four\\nenergy policy objectives of safety, reliability, affordability and environmental performance\\nto develop a diversified fuel mix for electricity generation. It will also try out the use of\\nnew energy sources and strengthen cooperation with neighbouring regions to increase zero-\\ncarbon electricity generation, with a view to ultimately achieving the goal of \"net-zero\\nelectricity generation\" before 2050.\\nVigorously promoting renewable energy. In the public sector, the HKSAR Government is\\ntaking the lead in developing renewable energy, including the development of large-scale\\nprojects in reservoirs and restored landfills. The HKSAR Government is constructing a 10-\\nmegawatt solar farm at the South East New Territories Landfill in Tseung Kwan O. Upon\\ncompletion in 2026, this large-scale project is expected to supply about 10 million kWh of\\nelectricity to nearby water facilities, which could meet the annual electricity demand of\\nabout 3,000 households and reduce carbon emissions by 7,000 tons per year.\\nBuilding\\nsmall-scale\\nrenewable\\nenergy\\nsystems.\\nSince\\n2017-2018,\\nthe\\nHKSAR\\nGovernment has earmarked a total of HK$ 3 billion for the installation of small-scale\\nrenewable energy systems at government premises. To date, around HK$ 2 billion has been\\napproved for approximately 220 projects, which collectively generate about 25 million\\nkWh of electricity per year. In addition, through inter-departmental efforts, the HKSAR\\nGovernment has been collaborating with various departments, including the Environmental\\nProtection Department (EPD), Water Supplies Department (WSD) and Drainage Services\\nDepartment (DSD), since 2022 to implement projects of small-scale system at about 50\\nselected premises, such as refuse transfer stations, waterworks facilities including pumping\\nstations and service reservoirs, as well as sewage treatment facilities including sewage\\ntreatment works and sewage pumping stations, with a view to enhancing space utilization.\\nThes electricity generated from them is anticipated on-site use, thereby saving electricity\\ncosts for the relevant departments and reducing carbon emissions.\\nPart V Information of HKSAR on Climate Change\\n256\\n\"Feed-in Tariff\" Scheme. To encourage the private sector to develop renewable energy on\\ntheir land and properties, the HKSAR Government launched the \"Feed-in Tariff\" Scheme in\\n2018. This initiative allows the private sector to sell the renewable energy electricity they\\ngenerate to the power companies at a rate higher than the normal electricity tariff rate, in\\norder to foster an investment market centered on renewable energy. To complement the\\n\"Feed-in Tariff\" Scheme, the HKSAR Government has also introduced a series of\\nsupporting measures, such as facilitating the private sector in installing solar energy\\ngeneration systems at open car parks, suitably relaxing he requirements for the installation\\nof solar energy generation systems on the rooftops of New Territories Exempted Houses\\n(i.e. village houses), revamping the \"HK RE Net\" and setting up an enquiry hotline,\\nintroducing legislative amendments to provide exemption from the requirements to apply\\nfor business registration and pay profits tax n respect of participation in and the payment\\nreceived under the Feed-in Tariff Scheme, etc.\\n\\nEnergy Saving and Green Buildings. In HKSAR, 90% of electricity is consumed by\\nbuildings, and more than 50% of carbon emissions come from electricity generation\\nassociated with building energy consumption. Promoting green buildings, improving\\nbuilding energy efficiency and adopting low-carbon lifestyles can reduce electricity\\nconsumption and power generation demand, as well as lessen the financial burden on\\ncitizens associated with the transition to cleaner energy generation. The HKSAR\\nGovernment aims to reduce electricity consumption in commercial buildings by 30%~40%\\nand residential buildings by 20%~30% by 2050 or earlier, compared to 2015 levels. The\\nHKSAR Government aims to achieve half of the above targets by 2035 or earlier.\\nEmphasizing building energy efficiency. Under the energy-saving measures related to the\\nBuildings Energy Efficiency Ordinance (hereinafter referred to as the \"Ordinance\"), the\\n2015 energy-saving benchmarks include the improved energy efficiency for newly\\nconstructed buildings and major renovation projects as a result of the triennial review of the\\nOrdinance and the Code of Practice for Building Energy Audit, as well as the energy-\\nsaving results from regular energy audits. The third phase of the Mandatory Energy\\nEfficiency Labelling Scheme came into effect in 2020. The HKSAR Government gazetted\\nand promulgated the Building Energy Code (2021 edition) on December 31, 2021, which\\ncomprehensively raised energy efficiency standards. Compared to the 2015 edition, the\\nupdated standards have improved overall energy efficiency by more than 15%. It is\\nestimated that by 2035, these measures could save approximately 4.7 to 5.3 billion kWh of\\nelectricity in buildings per year (compared to the 2015 level). By the end of 2022, the\\nenergy-saving measures implemented by the HKSAR Government had collectively saved\\n3.1 billion kWh of electricity (compared to the 2015 level). Of this, measures related to the\\nOrdinance had saved approximately 2.2 billion kWh of electricity for buildings per year\\n(compared to the 2015 level). Additionally, the relevant codes are being revised and will be\\nintroduced in 2024 to further enhance energy efficiency. As of the 2021-2022 financial year,\\nthe overall energy performance of the HKSAR Government improved by approximately\\n3.2%. By the 2022-2023 financial year, this improvement had increased to approximately\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n257\\n5.3%. Leading by example, the HKSAR Government planned to improve the overall\\nenergy performance of government buildings and infrastructure [56] by more than 6% in the\\n2024-2025 financial year [57] (compared to the 2018-2019 base year).\\nConducting building energy audits. The HKSAR Government has conducted energy audits\\nfor about 250 government buildings to systematically review the energy-consuming\\nequipment and systems in the buildings and identify energy management opportunities. It\\nalso encourages government departments to actively implement the energy-saving\\nmeasures recommended in the energy audit reports. The government will conduct retro-\\ncommissioning its buildings and implement energy-saving projects, such as replacement\\nwith LED lamps and adoption of high-efficiency air-conditioning units. During the\\nfinancial years 2017-2018 to 2021-2022, the total funding allocated for these projects\\namounted to approximately HK$ 800 million. The completed projects are expected to\\nachieve annual savings of approximately 50 million kWh of electricity.\\nFocusing on carbon audits. In 2008, the HKSAR Government introduced the Guidelines to\\nAccount for and Report on Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Removals for Buildings\\n(Commercial, Residential, or Public Use) in Hong Kong. In 2017, it further published nine\\ncarbon audit guidelines covering different types of buildings. Since 2017/2018 Fiscal Year,\\nthe HKSAR Government has taken the lead in conducting regular carbon audits for major\\ngovernment buildings with an annual electricity consumption exceeding 500,000 kWh.\\nThese audits aim to explore the potential for carbon reduction, and the results are disclosed\\nupon completion. Currently, the HKSAR Government requires more than 300 major\\ngovernment buildings of different uses to undergo carbon audit processes.\\nEnergy Efficiency Labelling Scheme. The HKSAR Government has implemented the\\nMandatory Energy Efficiency Labeling Scheme (hereinafter referred to as the \"Scheme\"),\\nrequiring prescribed products [58] supplied in the market to carry energy labels. This allows\\nconsumers to understand the energy efficiency performance of the products. The Scheme\\nhas been implemented by phases and covers eight categories of specified products as of the\\nend of 2022. The third phase has been fully implemented since December 1, 2019. Since\\nthe full implementation of the third phase, the grading standards have been upgraded twice.\\nIt is estimated that the entire Scheme can save about 750 million kWh of electricity per\\nyear (compared to 2015) for the consumers. The HKSAR Government will continue to\\nexpand the Mandatory Energy Efficiency Labeling Scheme by phases by including more\\nproducts and raising the energy efficiency rating standards.\\n\\nGreen transport. The HKSAR Government has been advocating green transport and\\nbuilding a public transport system with an efficient and zero-emission railway system as\\nthe backbone. HKSAR\\'s railway system carries over 4 million passengers daily, accounting\\n[56] Overall energy performance refers to the percentage difference in energy savings performance and\\nrenewable energy generation performance compared to the baseline year under comparable operating conditions.\\n[57] The fiscal year for the HKSAR runs from April 1 of each year to March 31 of the following year.\\n[58] Prescribed Products refers to products specified in the Energy Efficiency (Labelling of Products) Ordinance.\\nPart V Information of HKSAR on Climate Change\\n258\\nfor more than 40% of the total public transport ridership in Hong Kong. The operators will\\ncontinue to actively implement various environmental protection and low-carbon measures\\nto contribute to the achievement of carbon neutrality before 2050. For land transport, the\\nHKSAR Government introduced the first \"Hong Kong Roadmap on Popularisation of\\nElectric Vehicles\"[59] (hereinafter referred to as the \"Roadmap\") in 2021, which sets out a\\nclear direction for the full electrification of road transport in the future, including setting\\nthe target to have at least 150,000 parking spaces in private residential and commercial\\nbuildings equipped with electric vehicle charging infrastructure by 2025 or earlier. The\\nRoadmap states that by 2025, at least 5,000 public chargers will be made available for\\npublic use. This target was achieved ahead of schedule in 2022. In addition, the HKSAR\\nGovernment will announce a roadmap for promoting electric public transport and\\ncommercial vehicles by 2025 the latest.\\nTo combat global climate change, the full electrification of transportation system has\\nbecome a global trend. In order to improve air quality and achieve the long-term goal of\\nzero vehicle emissions, the HKSAR Government strive to promote the use of electric\\nvehicles. The key measures and progress are as follows: First, the HKSAR Government\\nintroduced the first Roadmap in 2021, setting out a clear direction for the full electrification\\nof road transport in the future. The number of electric vehicles in the HKSAR increased by\\nmore than 260 times from approximately 180 in 2010 to around 47,500 in 2022. The\\nproportion of electric private cars in newly registered private cars jumped from 6.3% in\\n2019 to 78.0% in the first quarter of 2024. Second, the HKSAR Government has been\\noffering various tax concessions in recent years to promote the popularization of electric\\nvehicles, such as exempting electric commercial vehicles from first registration tax and\\nimplementing the \"One-for-One Replacement\" [60]Scheme for electric private cars. The\\nHKSAR Government will also continue to expand the charging network and associated\\nsupporting infrastructure in multiple ways. Relevant measures include exempting the\\ncalculation of gross floor area of buildings and launching the \"EV-charging at Home\\nSubsidy Scheme\" with a total funding of HK$ 3.5 billion, to substantially increase the\\nprovision of electric vehicle charging facilities in car parks of existing housing estates and\\nnewly built buildings.\\nThe HKSAR Government is also actively promoting the trial of new energy commercial\\nvehicles through the \"New Energy Transport Fund\", aiming to collect more practical and\\noperational data for the trades’ reference. By the end of December 2022, the Fund had\\napproved more than 290 trials with a total subsidy of HK$ 253 million, including subsidies\\nfor the new generation electric taxis.\\n[59]\\nThe\\nURL\\nfor\\nthe\\nHong\\nKong\\nRoadmap\\non\\nPopularisation\\nof\\nElectric\\nVehicles\\nis\\nhttps://www.eeb.gov.hk/sites/default/files/pdf/EV_roadmap_eng.pdf.\\n[60] Since 1994, the HKSAR Government has exempted electric commercial vehicles from first registration tax\\n(until March 31, 2026); since February 2018, the “One-for-One Replacement” Scheme for electric private cars\\nhas been implemented, providing higher first registration tax concession for private car owners who arrange to\\nscrap and deregister their old private car and then first register a new electric private car under their name. In\\nFebruary 2024, the HKSAR Government announced a two-year extension of the electric vehicle first\\nregistration tax concession arrangement to March 31, 2026. From April 2024, the concession cap under the\\n“One-for-One Replacement” Scheme is HKD 172,500, while that for electric private car in general is HKD\\n58,500.\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n259\\nThe HKSAR Government is actively introducing more models of new energy vehicles,\\npromoting trial projects for various types of electric public transport, and establishing a\\ncomprehensive charging network to promote wider adoption of electric commercial\\nvehicles. The HKSAR Government has been working closely with relevant public transport\\noperators, including franchised bus operators, to promote the trial and development of new\\nenergy public transport such as electric buses and hydrogen fuel cell buses. The HKSAR\\nGovernment will also actively introduce smart and green mass transit systems to provide\\nlightweight and eco-friendly transport connections to nearby railway stations and major\\npublic transport hubs.\\nIn 2022, the HKSAR Government set up an Inter-departmental Working Group on Using\\nHydrogen as Fuel (hereinafter referred to as the \"Working Group\") to coordinate\\npreparation works of bureaux and departments for using hydrogen as fuel locally, with a\\nview to encouraging local adoption of hydrogen energy. The first key tasks of the Working\\nGroup are to examine applications for hydrogen trial projects, conduct risk assessments on\\nhydrogen filling stations, arrangements for replenishing hydrogen filling stations, and the\\nuse of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles on roads, as well as to review relevant regulations,\\nstandards and technical guidelines for the formulation of an operational safety framework\\nfor the use of hydrogen fuel in the transportation sector locally in the long run. Based on\\nlocal conditions, a hydrogen fuel cell double-decker bus commenced test run orderly in\\n2023. In 2024, trials will be conducted for hydrogen fuel cell heavy vehicles for street\\ncleansing to test their performance under local conditions.\\nThe Airport Authority Hong Kong (hereinafter referred to as the \"AAHK\"), together with\\nits major aviation-related business partners, have committed to achieving net-zero carbon\\nemissions by the end of 2050. They have also set a midpoint target of reducing actual\\nemissions by 55% by 2035 from a 2018 baseline. The AAHK has developed a detailed\\ncarbon management action plan, outlining specific actions and a roadmap to achieve its\\ncarbon reduction targets. Specific measures include electrifying vehicles used at the airside,\\nsignificantly increasing the number of electric vehicle charging stations to over 1,300 by\\nthe end of 2030, implementing a Ground Services Equipment Pooling Scheme [61], piloting\\nthe use of hydrogen energy, and launching the \"Hong Kong International Airport Business\\nPartners Carbon Support Programme\"[62].\\nShipping. As an international shipping hub, the HKSAR has been consistently promoting\\ngreen port development through various measures and encouraging the industry to adopt\\n[61] Under the Ground Services Equipment Pooling Scheme, the AAHK is responsible for procuring, managing,\\nand maintaining ground services equipment such as conveyor belt loaders, lower deck loaders and passenger\\nsteps. These critical ground services equipment will be stationed on each parking stand for rental by the ramp\\nhandling operators. To facilitate speedy ground services equipment servicing and reshuffling, the AAHK has\\nbuilt two dedicated ground services equipment maintenance workshops and deployed a fleet management\\nsystem to monitor the usage and performance of each ground services equipment.\\n[62] As part of the “Hong Kong International Airport Business Partners Carbon Support Programme”, the\\nAAHK\\nlaunched a Greenovation Fund in October 2022 to encourage business partners to pilot new\\ntechnologies and accelerate decarbonization efforts. Additionally, in March 2022, the AAHK, in collaboration\\nwith the Business Environment Council, launched the Hong Kong International Airport Carbon Capacity\\nBuilding Programme to help business partners build knowledge and skills in carbon management.\\nPart V Information of HKSAR on Climate Change\\n260\\nmore sustainable shipping practices. The HKSAR is the first port in Asia to mandate ocean-\\ngoing vessels to switch to low-sulfur fuel while at berth. The Government has also\\ncollaborated with Mainland China to reduce emissions from ships. In 2019, it partnered\\nwith the Guangdong Provincial Government to establish a vessel emission control area in\\nthe Pearl River Delta waters. The regulations were further tightened, requiring all vessels,\\nwhether in navigation or at berth, to use compliant fuels such as 0.5% low-sulfur fuel or\\nliquefied natural gas. The HKSAR is actively promoting the use of clean energy such as\\nliquefied natural gas for ocean-going vessels to attract those using clean energy to berth in\\nHong Kong for bunkering.\\nIn response to the HKSAR Chief Executive\\'s 2023 Policy Address, the Government has\\ninitiated a feasibility study on providing green methanol bunkering for both local and\\nocean-going vessels. An action plan will be promulgated in 2024 for the construction of\\nbunkering facilities and development of supply chains. The Government will also take\\nforward the preparatory work, including technical studies and installations, on providing\\nliquefied natural gas bunkering for ocean-going vessels.\\n\\nWaste reduction. In order to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality in waste management by\\n2050, the HKSAR Government released the Waste Blueprint for Hong Kong 2035[63] in\\n2021. Guided by the vision of \"Waste Reduction, Resources Circulation, and Zero Landfill\",\\nthe blueprint outlines various strategies and measures for waste management to promote\\nwaste reduction and recycling at full steam to minimize overall waste volume, with the aim\\nof gradually reducing the per capita disposal rate of solid waste by 40%~45% and\\nincreasing the recycling rate from 32% to about 55%. At the same time, the HKSAR\\nGovernment is pressing ahead with the development of a network of advanced and highly\\nefficient modern waste-to-energy facilities, including modern waste-to-energy incinerators\\n(I·PARKs), sludge treatment facility (T·PARK), and organic resources recovery centers\\n(O·PARKs), with a view of moving away from the reliance on landfills for direct disposal\\nof municipal solid waste by 2035. These facilities will convert waste into useful energy,\\ncontributing to HKSAR\\'s transformation into a sustainable green city and the achievement\\nof carbon neutrality.\\nLandfill disposal of municipal solid waste will produce landfill gas, which primarily\\nconsists of methane. In order to further mitigate the environmental issues caused by landfill\\ngas emission, landfills have gradually installed gas extraction wells and pipelines based on\\nthe actual operation conditions. These wells and pipelines are connected to landfill gas\\ncollection system to ensure proper recovery and utilization. The recovered landfill gas is\\nused for electricity generation to support the operation of the landfills themselves or as a\\nheating fuel for the leachate treatment works. After purification, the remaining landfill gas\\nis either transferred to the pipeline network of The Hong Kong and China Gas Company\\nLimited or used for electricity generation and connected to the public power grid. The\\n[63]\\nThe\\nURL\\nfor\\nthe\\nWaste\\nBlueprint\\nfor\\nHong\\nKong\\n2035\\nis\\nhttps://www.eeb.gov.hk/sites/default/files/pdf/waste_blueprint_2035_eng.pdf.\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n261\\nEnvironmental Protection Department will continue to establish landfill gas collection\\nsystems to collect more landfill gas for treatment and utilization. In addition, mobile\\nlandfill gas flaring systems are installed at landfills as needed to completely combust a\\nportion of the landfill gas delivered to the extraction system within the routine operational\\nareas.\\nTo ensure the community has adequate recycling facilities in the community, the HKSAR\\nGovernment\\ncontinues\\nto\\nexpand\\nthe\\ncommunity\\nrecycling\\nnetwork,\\n\"GREEN@COMMUNITY\", with a focus on supporting residents in residential premises\\nwith limited space for their own recycling facilities to participate in source separation and\\nclean recycling. By the end of 2022, there were more than 160 collection points for at least\\neight types of common recyclables. In 2022, the recycling volume reached 20,000 tons, a\\n40% increase compared to 2021. In addition, the HKSAR Government plans to introduce\\nlegislation requiring large residential estates and single-block residential buildings with a\\nsignificant of households to establish recycling systems for the separate collection of\\ncommon recyclables, with a view to further expanding the recycling network.\\nThe HKSAR Government fully implemented the Producer Responsibility Scheme (PRS)\\non Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) in 2018, requiring relevant\\nstakeholders to share the responsibility for the recovery, recycling, treatment and disposal\\nof waste products with a view to preventing and minimizing their environmental impact.\\nBy the end of 2022, the treatment facilities funded by the HKSAR Government had\\nprocessed over 100,000 tons of WEEE. In addition, the legislative procedure for the PRS\\non Glass Beverage Containers had been completed, and the scheme was implemented on\\nMay 1, 2023. In May 2021, the HKSAR Government conducted a public consultation on\\nimplementing a PRS on Plastic Beverage Containers and is currently drafting the details of\\nthe scheme.\\nIn order to reduce and properly manage plastic waste, the HKSAR Government has fully\\nimplemented the Plastic Shopping Bag Charging Scheme (hereinafter referred to as the\\n\"Charging Scheme\") since 2015. Compared to the period before the full implementation of\\nthe scheme (2014), the disposal quantity of plastic shopping bags had decreased by 8% by\\nthe end of 2022. In order to further reduce the use of plastic shopping bags, the HKSAR\\nGovernment has increased the charge per bag from at least HK$0.5 to HK$1 and tightened\\nthe scope of exemption since December 31, 2022. The HKSAR Government has also\\nstarted drafting legislation to regulate disposable plastic tableware and other plastic\\nproducts, aiming to implement it in phases starting from the second quarter of 2024. In\\naddition, starting from the end of March 2022, the HKSAR Government has gradually\\nexpanded the waste plastics recycling services to collect all types of non-industrial and\\nnon-commercial waste plastics for proper recycling and treatment. Together with the waste\\nplastics collected through the \"GREEN@COMMUNITY\" recycling network, as well as by\\nother non-profit and private organizations, the total amount of recycled waste plastics in\\n2022 was approximately 120,000 tons.\\nThe HKSAR Government launched a territory-wide waste paper collection and recycling\\nservice in September 2020, with a total recycling volume of approximately 580,000 tons by\\nPart V Information of HKSAR on Climate Change\\n262\\nthe end of 2022. The construction of HKSAR\\'s first modern pulping facility was confirmed\\nin 2022 and it is expected to commence operation in 2025, with a capacity to process about\\n630,000 tons of local waste paper annually (including cardboard, newspapers and office\\npaper). In addition, to complement the implementation of the \"PRS on Glass Beverage\\nContainers\", the HKSAR Government has progressively introduced waste glass container\\ncollection services since 2018, with a total recycling volume of more than 84,000 tons by\\nthe end of 2022.\\n\\nHKSAR does not have large-scale industries, and local industrial GHG emissions mainly\\noriginate from cement production processes and coal-based energy consumption. Since\\n2019, cement production enterprises in the HKSAR have been using biomass (wood) and\\nalternative fuels (polyurethane and rubber from recycling) as auxiliary fuels. Starting from\\n2020, these enterprises have reduced the percentage of using silicate cement clinker and\\nsubstituted by Ground Granulated Blast-furnace Slag (GGBS). These measures have not\\nonly successfully reduced the consumption of fossil fuels but also significantly alleviated\\nthe waste burden on landfills in the HKSAR. CO2 emissions was reduced due to using less\\nsilicate cement clinker.\\nIn addition, the HKSAR Government, through the \"Cleaner Production Partnership\\nProgramme\"[64], supports Hong Kong-owned factories located in HKSAR and Guangdong\\nProvince to adopt cleaner production technologies and practices to enhance their\\nenvironmental performance, reducing raw material consumption and save energy.\\n\\nHKSAR has established 24 country parks and 22 special areas, covering a total area of\\napproximately 44,300 hectares, which accounts for about 40% of Hong Kong\\'s land area.\\nThese areas have been managed and protected properly over the years. Between 2020 and\\n2022, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) of the HKSAR\\nGovernment planted over 730,000 native trees in the protected areas. AFCD also\\ncontinuously carried out plantation enrichment work in manmade plantation areas of low\\necological value and implemented effective hill fire prevention measures. These efforts aim\\nto gradually expand forest coverage, enhance biodiversity and sustainability, and protect\\nthe natural \"carbon sink\" function of ecosystems.\\nAdditionally, the wetlands of about 1,500 hectares in Mai Po and Inner Deep Bay are\\ndesignated as internationally important wetlands under the Ramsar Convention. The Mai\\nPo and Inner Deep Bay wetlands, with over 400 hectares of mangroves, serve as important\\nand efficient blue-green carbon sinks, offering exceptional carbon sequestration efficiency.\\nAFCD is responsible for the overall conservation of the internationally important wetlands\\nin Mai Po and Inner Deep Bay. This includes implementing the Mai Po Inner Deep Bay\\nRamsar Site Management Plan, categorizing the Ramsar sites into different management\\n[64] For detailed policy descriptions, refer to Chapter 3, Section 3, “3.

AFCD commenced a strategic feasibility\\nstudy in August 2022 to investigate the relevant details for taking forward the proposed\\nestablishment of the wetland conservation parks system in the Northern Metropolis and the\\nimplementation of proactive management measures. Currently, HKSAR is planning for the\\ndevelopment of the Sam Po Shue Wetland Conservation Park, which will create synergy\\nwith the Mai Po Nature Reserve and other existing wetlands to effectively protect the\\nwetland habitats in the Deep Bay area.\\n\\nThe Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone\\nLayer (Kigali Amendment), adopted in 2016, aims to gradually reduce the annual\\nproduction and consumption of 18 hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) with high Global Warming\\nPotential (GWP). Under the Kigali Amendment, the HKSAR is required to establish and\\nimplement a licensing and quota system on the import and export of HFCs and to gradually\\nreduce the consumption of HFCs by 85% from the baseline level in 2036. Since China\\'s\\nformal acceptance of the Kigali Amendment in June 2021, the HKSAR Government has\\nactively engaged with relevant trade, including trade associations, equipment suppliers and\\nHFC importers, to discuss the introduction of low-GWP products and equipment to Hong\\nKong. In 2022, the HKSAR Government established an inter-departmental working group\\nto develop control proposal based on the collected information and planned to consult\\nindustry stakeholders on these proposals in 2023.\\n\\n\\nIn \"Hong Kong\\'s Climate Action Plan 2050\" announced in October 2021, the HKSAR\\nGovernment announced that it would invest about HK$ 240 billion over the next 15 to 20\\nyears to implement various mitigation and adaptation measures. These include energy\\nconservation and renewable energy, green transport, waste management, strengthening\\ncoastal management, slope reinforcement, and drainage system improvement works.\\nIn 2018, the HKSAR Government launched the \"Government Green Bond Programme\"\\n(hereinafter referred to as the \"GGB Programme\") to fund the government\\'s green projects.\\nIn May 2024, the scope of the GGB Programme was expanded to include sustainable\\nprojects, and it was therefore renamed as the \"Government Sustainable Bond Programme\".\\nAt present, the HKSAR Government has successfully issued government green bonds\\nequivalent to a total of approximately HK$ 195 billion, covering 72 green projects. In the\\n2024-2025 financial year, the HKSAR Government plans to issue bonds totaling HK$ 120\\nbillion, of which HK$ 70 billion will be retail bonds, including HK$ 20 billion of green\\nbonds and infrastructure bonds. In addition to promoting inclusive finance, it aims to\\nPart V Information of HKSAR on Climate Change\\n264\\nenhance the public\\'s sense of participation in infrastructure and sustainable development\\nprojects.\\nAchieving carbon neutrality requires significant financial resources. HKSAR needs to\\nvigorously develop various financing tools to attract more capital towards projects that\\ncontribute to carbon reduction. The Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering\\nGroup (hereinafter referred to as the \"Steering Group\"), established in May 2020, is co-\\nchaired by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (hereinafter referred to as \"HKMA\") and\\nthe Securities & Futures Commission of Hong Kong (SFC), with members including the\\nEnvironmental Bureau, Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, Hong Kong\\nExchanges and Clearing Limited, Insurance Authority, and Mandatory Provident Fund\\nSchemes Authority. The Steering Group aims to coordinate the financial sector\\'s response\\nto climate and environmental risks, accelerate the development of green and sustainable\\nfinance in Hong Kong, and support the government\\'s climate strategies. The Steering\\nGroup will focus on advancing climate-related disclosure and sustainability reporting,\\nexploring carbon market opportunities, and enhancing initiatives as a green and sustainable\\nfinance center, with the aim of consolidating HKSAR\\'s leadership in green and sustainable\\nfinance and supporting the financial ecosystem\\'s transition toward carbon neutrality.\\nIn October 2022, the HKEX launched Core Climate, a new international carbon\\nmarketplace. It is currently the only carbon market that offers settlement services in both\\nHong Kong dollars (HK$) and Renminbi (RMB) for international voluntary carbon credit\\nproduct trading. By the end of 2023, the number of registered participants had tripled to\\nabout 80 members. Core Climate supports efficient and transparent trading of carbon credit\\nproducts and instruments, facilitating the global net-zero emission transition. The high-\\nquality carbon credits traded on the Core Climate platform are sourced from over 40\\ninternationally certified carbon reduction projects, including forestry, solar energy, wind\\nenergy and biomass projects in Asia, South America, and West Africa. All projects on the\\nplatform, including carbon avoidance, reduction and removal projects, are verified under\\nthe Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) by Verra.\\nAccurate information disclosure is crucial to promoting sustainable finance. This will also\\nbe a priority for international organizations and government agencies in the coming years.\\nTo deepen the development of green and sustainable finance in HKSAR, enterprises must\\nalign their sustainability disclosure in financial reporting with international standards. In\\nMarch 2024, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau issued a statement setting out\\nthe vision and approach of the government and financial regulators for developing a\\ncomprehensive sustainability disclosure ecosystem in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong\\nInstitute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), as the sustainability disclosure\\nstandard setter of Hong Kong, will develop local Sustainability Reporting Standards\\n(hereinafter referred to as the \"Hong Kong Standards\") aligned with the ISSB Standards, as\\nwell as complementary application and implementation guidance. The goal is to launch a\\nroadmap in 2024 for appropriately adopting the ISSB Standards in Hong Kong, and\\nprovide enterprises with a transparent and well-defined pathway for sustainability reporting,\\nensuring they have sufficient time for making preparations and developing readiness for the\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n265\\npragmatic implementation of the Hong Kong Standards. To prepare listed companies\\ntowards eventual sustainability reporting under the Hong Kong Standards, the Hong Kong\\nExchanges and Clearing Limited published the Consultation summary in April 2024\\nregarding the Consultation Paper on the Enhancement of Climate-related Disclosures under\\nthe Environmental, Social and Governance Framework and introduced new climate-related\\ndisclosure requirements (hereinafter referred to as the \"new climate requirements\"). The\\nnew climate requirements are developed based on ISSB Standard No. 2: Climate-related\\nDisclosures and include implementation reliefs. These reliefs include proportionality and\\nscaling-in measures to address concerns over the reporting challenges that some issuers\\nmay face. The revised Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited Listing Rules will\\ncome into effect on January 1, 2025.\\nThe GHG Emission Calculation Tools, jointly developed by the Steering Group and the\\nHong Kong University of Science and Technology, was launched in February 2024. It is\\navailable to the public for free on the Steering Group\\'s website to assist Hong Kong\\nenterprises and financial institutions in sustainability reporting. The tool can help small and\\nmedium-sized enterprises manage their environmental footprint while encouraging market\\nparticipants to improve their sustainable business practices.\\nIn early May 2024, the HKMA published the \"Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable\\nFinance\" (hereinafter referred to as the \"Hong Kong Taxonomy\"), which serves as a pivotal\\ntool to raise awareness about green finance, promote common understanding on green\\nactivities, facilitate green finance flows, and provide a foundation for further application.\\nThe Hong Kong Taxonomy aligns with the two major standards from China and the\\nEuropean Union. Currently, it encompasses twelve economic activities under four sectors:\\npower generation, transportation, construction, water and waste management. For the next\\nstep, the HKMA will expand the coverage of the taxonomy to include more sectors and\\nactivities, including transition activities.\\n\\nThe specific mitigation measures and effects across various sectors in HKSAR are detailed\\nin Table 5-21.\\nPart V Information of HKSAR on Climate Change\\n266\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\nHong\\nKong\\'s\\nClimate\\nAction\\nPlan 2050\\nIn\\nOctober\\n2021,\\nHong\\nKong\\'s\\nClimate\\nAction\\nPlan\\n2050\\nwas\\nreleased,\\nsetting\\nout\\nfour\\nmajor\\ndecarbonization strategies, i.e. \"net-\\nzero electricity generation\", \"energy\\nsaving and green buildings\", \"green\\ntransport\" and \"waste reduction\".

Over the past century,\\nthe number of very hot days and hot nights in Hong Kong has increased significantly; the\\nintensity of tropical cyclones and associated extreme rainfall has also risen. The HKSAR\\nGovernment will continue relevant studies and optimize various response measures.\\nSince its establishment in 2016, the \"Climate Change Working Group on Infrastructure\"\\n(hereinafter referred to as CCWGI) of the HKSAR Government has been coordinating\\nclimate change adaptation efforts in the infrastructure sector as well as relevant studies to\\nstrengthen the resilience of infrastructure. The CCWGI is convened by the Civil Engineering\\nand Development Department (CEDD) with members from the Development Bureau, the\\nArchitectural Services Department, the Buildings Department, the Drainage Services\\nDepartment (DSD), the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD), the\\nHighways Department (HyD), the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) and the Water Supplies\\nDepartment (WSD). The CCWGI regularly reports its work plans and progress to the\\ninterdepartmental \"Steering Committee on Climate Change and Carbon Neutrality\", chaired\\nby the Chief Executive of the HKSAR.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe trends in climate change observed in HKSAR basically align with the overall global\\ntrends. The HKO began to make systematic observations of meteorological parameters in the\\n1880s. As shown by the temperature trend, the annual mean temperature increased at an\\naverage rate of 0.28°C per decade during 1990-2022 (Figure 5-5). The inter-annual variation\\nin annual rainfall is significant, with an overall long-term upward trend. Regarding the rising\\ntrend in sea level, there was s significant rise of sea level at Victoria Harbour of Hong Kong\\nduring 1990-2022, with an average rate of increase of 41 mm per decade.\\n\\nTemperature\\n+0.28°C/decade\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n273\\n\\nHKO updated the climate projections for Hong Kong based on global climate model data of\\nthe Sixth Assessment Report of IPCC. The conclusion are as follows: First, under the low,\\nintermediate and very high GHG emissions scenarios\\n[66], the average annual mean\\ntemperature in 2081-2100 is expected to rise by about 1.2°C, 2.0°C and 3.6°C respectively,\\nwhen compared with the average annual mean temperature of 23.4°C during 1995-2014,\\nwhile the average annual maximum temperature in 2081-2100 is expected to rise by about\\n1.2°C, 1.9°C and 4.1°C respectively, when compared with the average figure of 34.4°C\\nduring 1995-2014. Second, under the low, intermediate and very high GHG emissions\\nscenarios, the average annual rainfall in 2081-2100 is expected to rise by about 8%, 7% and\\n9% when compared to the average annual rainfall of 2,456 mm during 1995-2014 [67], while\\nthe average annual maximum daily rainfall in 2081-2100 is expected to rise by about 9%,\\n16% and 28% respectively when compared to the average figure of 203 mm during 1995-\\n2014. Third, under the low, intermediate and very high GHG emissions scenarios, the annual\\nmean sea level of Hong Kong in 2100 is expected to rise by about 0.42 m, 0.56 m and 0.78 m\\nrespectively (in terms of median), compared with the average value during 1995-2014 (1.45\\nm above Hong Kong Chart Datum); extreme water levels caused by sea level rise are also\\nexpected to increase significantly.\\n\\nSome significant weather events that occurred in HKSAR from 2020 to 2022 are summarized\\nbelow:\\n\\nYear 2021 was the warmest year on record in HKSAR since 1884, with an annual mean\\ntemperature of 24.6°C, which was 1.1°C above the normal value in 1991-2020. In 2021, the\\nnumber of hot nights [68] was 61, and the number of very hot days [69] was 54, both being the\\nhighest on record.\\nJuly 2022 was the hottest month on record in HKSAR. The monthly mean temperature\\nreached 30.3°C, 1.4°C above the normal, marking the highest monthly mean temperature on\\nrecord. In July 2022, the HKO recorded 10 days with a daily maximum temperature of\\n35.0°C or above, 21 very hot days, and 25 hot nights, all breaking their respective monthly\\nrecords. The 21 consecutive hot nights starting from July 9 also set a new record.\\n\\nAffected by a trough of low pressure over the coastal area of Guangdong, heavy rain and\\nsevere squally thunderstorms occurred in HKSAR on the morning of June 6, 2020. On that\\nday, most parts of HKSAR recorded over 100 mm of rainfall, with some areas receiving more\\n[66]\\nFor\\nprojections\\nunder\\nalternative\\nGHG\\nemissions\\nscenarios,\\nsee\\nhttps://www.hko.gov.hk/en/climate_change/future_climate.htm.\\n[67] Due to fluctuations in rainfall, although the overall trend is increasing, years with lower-than-average\\nrainfall cannot be ruled out.\\n[68] This refers to days when the minimum temperature is 28.0°C or above.\\n[69] This refers to days when the maximum temperature reaches 33.0°C or above.\\nPart V Information of HKSAR on Climate Change\\n274\\nthan 200 mm of rainfall. Severe flooding occurred in some areas. The heavy rainstorm is\\nestimated to have caused direct economic losses of approximately HK$ 37 million in\\nHKSAR.\\n\\nTyphoon Higos struck HKSAR on the morning of August 19, 2020, with offshore areas and\\nsome high ground experiencing storm-force and hurricane-force winds, respectively. The\\nheavy squally showers associated with the rain bands of Typhoon Higos brought over 150\\nmm of rainfall to most parts of HKSAR on August 18 and 19, 2020. During the passage of\\nTyphoon Higos in HKSAR, at least 7 people were injured, with around 800 reports of fallen\\ntrees and 2 reports of flooding. Typhoon Higos is estimated to have caused direct economic\\nlosses of approximately HK$ 388 million in HKSAR.\\nTropical Storm Lionrock and Typhoon Kompasu successively affected HKSAR during the\\nweek of October 8 to 14, 2021. Lionrock brought gale-force winds and heavy squally\\nshowers to HKSAR from October 8 to 10, 2021. On October 8, 2021, the rainfall was\\nparticularly heavy and persistent, with over 200 mm of rainfall generally recorded in HKSAR.\\nThe HKO recorded a rainfall of 329.7 mm on that day, the highest daily rainfall recorded in\\nOctober. During the passage of Typhoon Lionrock in Hong Kong, two people died, at least 14\\nwere injured, and there were over 1,100 reports of fallen trees, 6 reports of flooding, and 3\\nreports of landslides. Typhoon Lionrock is estimated to have caused direct economic losses of\\napproximately HK$ 220 million in HKSAR. During the passage of Typhoon Kompasu in\\nHKSAR, at least 20 people were injured, with 877 reports of fallen trees and 10 reports of\\nflooding. Typhoon Kompasu is estimated to have caused direct economic losses of\\napproximately HK$ 35 million in HKSAR.\\n\\n\\n\\nHKSAR lacks fresh water resources. There are no natural lakes, rivers or substantial\\nunderground water sources. Besides rainwater collected from local catchment, HKSAR needs\\nto import water from the Dongjiang River in Guangdong Province with annual supply ceiling\\nof 820 million m3 according to the current Dongjiang water supply agreement. In 2022, the\\ntotal water consumption of Hong Kong was about 1,385 million m3, of which around 58%\\nwas imported water from the Dongjiang River in Guangdong Province, 19% was locally\\ncollected rainwater, and the remaining 23% was seawater for toilet flushing. In face of the\\nchallenges of climate change and increasing fresh water demand due to population and\\neconomic growth, the HKSAR Government has included climate change adaptation into its\\nwater resources management strategy since 2008 to ensure water security and support for\\nsustainable development in HKSAR. In addition to implementing hardware measures (such\\nas using flow controllers), the Water Supplies Department has launched publicity and\\npromotion of water conservation; implemented initiatives to reduce water loss in supply\\nnetworks; built up a diversified water resource portfolio through exploitation of new water\\nresources that are not susceptible to climate change, which include development of seawater\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n275\\ndesalination and expansion of the use of lower grade water (viz. seawater and recycled water)\\nfor non-potable purposes; and has been continuously exploring efficient utilization of local\\nwater resources to enhance the resilience of Hong Kong\\'s water supply.\\n\\nThe main vegetation in HKSAR includes woodland, shrublands and grasslands, collectively\\ncovering more than 60% of the land area. These areas serve as important habitats for a wide\\nvariety of native flora and fauna. Climate change may potentially impact the composition,\\nstructure and function of vegetation. With changes in temperature and rainfall, the phenology,\\nmigratory habits and interactions of wildlife may be altered, thereby affecting the distribution\\nand survival of populations. Cold-adapted organisms in higher-altitude habitats are\\nparticularly more sensitive to climate change. Frequent disasters caused by extreme weather,\\nsuch as flash floods and landslides, will severely impact the habitats of terrestrial wildlife and\\npose significant threats to fragile ecosystems.\\n\\nHKSAR is located in a subtropical region with the marine environment suitable for the\\ngrowth of organisms adapted to tropical and temperate climates, boasting a wide variety of\\nmarine species. Although Hong Kong is close to the northern edge of the growth zone for\\nstony corals, over 80 species of stony corals are still found within its territory. Data shows\\nthat the sea temperature in Hong Kong increased by 1.25°C between 1986 and 2014. Studies\\nfrom other parts of the world indicate that rising sea temperatures can drive the distribution of\\nmarine species toward the poles. Additionally, increased sea temperatures can cause coral\\nbleaching by expelling their symbiotic algae, making corals fragile and vulnerable to disease.\\nFurthermore, ocean warming will reduce the solubility of oxygen in seawater, leading to a\\ndecrease in overall oxygen content in the ocean and resulting in the death of marine\\norganisms. As surface seawater absorbs more carbon dioxide, its pH value decreases, leading\\nto ocean acidification, which impacts the calcification process of marine organisms that need\\nto build calcium-containing shells and tissues. Sea level rising will also impact coastal\\necosystems, including mangroves and shallow coral reefs. The HKSAR Government will\\ncontinue to support research on the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems,\\nincluding collaborating with universities to monitor coral bleaching. The monitoring results\\nindicate that most bleached coral communities will recover afterward.\\n\\n\\n\\nHong Kong is an open economy with minimal agricultural and livestock production. Local\\nfarms mainly produce vegetables, live pigs and live chickens, accounting for 1.9%, 13.8%\\nand 100% of the annual local consumption, respectively. Over 90% of Hong Kong\\'s food\\nsupply relies on imports.\\nThe policy objective of the HKSAR Government regarding food is to ensure an open market\\nas well as food safety and stable supply. Considering HKSAR\\'s high dependency on imported\\nPart V Information of HKSAR on Climate Change\\n276\\nfood, the government has been maintaining close communication with key stakeholders in the\\nfood supply industry, including major market players at both the import and retail levels, so\\nas to ensure a comprehensive understanding of market conditions at various levels and take\\ntimely measures to safeguard the stability of food supply.\\nAt the same time, the HKSAR Government has implemented various measures to assist the\\nindustry in addressing climate change and promoting sustainable development. In terms of\\ncrop production, the HKSAR Government provides technical training to guide farmers in\\nselecting suitable crop varieties to enhance crop yield and quality. It also assists farmers in\\ntransitioning to environmentally friendly organic farming to reduce their carbon footprint and\\nactively promote sustainable development. Additionally, the government encourages the\\nadoption of controlled-environment greenhouse technology and hydroponic technology,\\nenabling all-weather agricultural production. In terms of poultry and livestock production, the\\nHKSAR Government encourages the industry to adopt multi-story poultry and livestock\\nfarming facilities to effectively improve the resource utilization efficiency. Simultaneously,\\nthe government aims to reduce GHG emissions by implementing environmental control,\\nadvanced technologies and automated equipment, and also integrates energy-saving\\ntechnologies to further reduce energy consumption.\\n\\nIn order to prevent vector-borne diseases and heat-related diseases caused by climate change,\\nthe Department of Health (DH) has been disseminating related information through various\\nchannels. In addition to enhancing public awareness of mosquito-borne diseases and\\npromoting protective measures against mosquito bites, the DH also collaborates with the\\nHKO to timely issue press releases to remind the public to take appropriate measures against\\nheat stroke and ultraviolet radiation during very hot weather.\\n\\nThe HKSAR Government has identified approximately 350 critical infrastructure facilities\\nfrom seven categories including buildings infrastructure, port works infrastructure, drainage\\nand sewerage infrastructure, transport infrastructure, water supplies infrastructure, waste\\nmanagement infrastructure and fill management infrastructure for vulnerability and impact\\nassessments. The HKSAR Government has formulated the scope of enhancement works for\\nthe Government critical infrastructure.\\n\\nThe HKSAR Government\\'s completed and ongoing planning and engineering feasibility\\nstudies have not specifically provided quantitative or qualitative assessments of the\\nsocioeconomic impacts of climate change on urban and living environment. However,\\nconsidering the impact of frequent extreme weather events on citizens\\' daily lives and\\npotential economic losses, the HKSAR Government has incorporated climate change and\\nother environmental factors as key considerations in its planning and development processes.\\nIt advocates for an integrated planning approach that incorporates the concepts of wisdom,\\nenvironmental protection and resilience to ensure that essential infrastructure in HKSAR is\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n277\\nequipped to address climate change, providing communities with uninterrupted and\\nconvenient services.\\n\\nHKSAR\\'s economy is dominated by the tertiary industry, with limited energy-intensive\\nindustries. The service sector accounted for 93.5% of Hong Kong\\'s GDP in 2022, in which\\ntransportation contributed 6.9% of GDP. In the secondary industry, manufacturing industry,\\nand water, electricity and gas supply accounted for only 1.0% and 1.2% of GDP, respectively,\\nwhile the construction industry accounted for 4.3%. In 2022, electricity generation was the\\nlargest source of carbon emissions, followed by transport and waste. These three major\\nemission sources collectively accounted for about 90% of total emissions, making them the\\nthree most key areas for HKSAR\\'s decarbonization efforts.\\nClimate change may impact various aspects of the HKSAR\\'s economy. For example, the\\nfrequent occurrence of extreme weather events and the related damage results in higher\\nmaintenance and insurance costs for businesses and industries. On financial services, damage\\nfrom extreme weather poses risks to telecommunications and computer system failure,\\npotentially disrupting financial market transactions. The insurance industry is also exposed to\\nheightened extreme weather risks. Moreover, on energy supply, extreme weather can damage\\npower lines and other capital, and rising temperatures and extreme weather events drive up\\nenergy demand, thereby increasing the risk of power supply interruptions and power spikesß.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo address the impacts of sea level rise and extreme sea waves due to climate change, the\\nHKSAR Government has established an early alert system. When the HKO predicts that sea\\nlevels in certain high-risk areas will exceed the warning threshold, it will issue alerts to\\nrelevant departments. The relevant departments will dispatch emergency response teams to\\nassist local residents and notify affected individuals. Temporary shelters are also opened\\nwhen necessary to mitigate the effects of seawater inundation on local residents.\\nLandslides in HKSAR are mostly triggered by heavy rainfall. The CEDD and the HKO will\\nissue landslip warnings when a heavy rainfall which may trigger landslide is forecasted,\\nalerting the public to take precautionary measures. Government departments will also activate\\nemergency response systems to quickly mobilize manpower and resources to address\\nlandslides incidents. The DSD has also set up an \"Emergency Control Center\" and installed\\ntelemetry systems at various locations across Hong Kong. These systems collect data on\\nrainfall, tide levels and water levels at the site, and transmit it to the monitoring center for\\nrapid analysis of flooding situations. When necessary, the center will notify other departments\\nto prepare for rescue, evacuation and the opening of temporary shelters. The HKO continues\\nto review and enhance its meteorological observation network in a timely manner to support\\nlong-term\\nclimate\\nchange\\nmonitoring\\nand\\nanalysis.\\nSince\\n2018,\\nthe\\nGuangdong\\nPart V Information of HKSAR on Climate Change\\n278\\nMeteorological Bureau, the HKO, and the Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau\\nhave jointly compiled the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Climate Bulletin\\nannually.\\nBased on the Natural Disaster Contingency Plan, various departments of the HKSAR\\nGovernment\\nperform\\ntheir\\nrespective\\nroles\\nin\\ndisaster\\npreparedness,\\nresponse\\nand\\nrehabilitation, and continuously improve their response strategies and plans. Various\\ngovernment departments have also established regular monitoring systems to address extreme\\nweather and natural disasters. These systems will give early alerts to the public during\\ndisaster response efforts.\\nClimate change has led to more extreme rainfall and increasingly intense tropical cyclones.\\nTo enhance capabilities for monitoring and forecasting of heavy rain and tropical cyclones,\\nthe HKO has applied artificial intelligence technology to its forecasting systems, and\\ndeveloped an experimental flood risk assessment system to support emergency departments\\nin making preparations and implementing contingency plans. Additionally, the HKSAR\\nGovernment has established an early alert system for coastal low-lying and windy areas in\\nresponse to storm surges caused by tropical cyclones. Meanwhile, in order to address the\\nincrease in high-temperature weather due to global warming, the HKO has strengthened its\\nvery hot weather warning service by providing special alerts for \"prolonged heat\" and\\n\"extremely hot weather\" with a view to reminding the public to take appropriate\\nprecautionary measures.\\nIn 2023, the Labour Department introduced the \"Heat Stress at Work Warning\" based on the\\n\"Hong Kong Heat Index\". The warning system includes three levels: amber, red and black, to\\nguide employers and employees in assessing heat stress risks and formulating preventive and\\ncontrol measures. In addition, the Labour Department will promulgate the active levels of the\\n\"Heat Stress at Work Warning\" and preventive measures against heat stress in relevant work\\nthrough mobile applications, government press releases, websites and major media outlets.\\n\\nThe \"Climate Change Working Group on Infrastructure\" has completed several studies,\\nincluding \"Study on Resilience of Government Critical Infrastructure in Hong Kong under\\nExtreme Weather\", \"Sensitivity Test under Direct Hit by Super Typhoons\", \"Frequency\\nAnalysis of Extreme Sea Levels\", \"Projection of Extreme Winds\", and \"Study of Potential\\nImpacts on Government Infrastructure under Extreme Temperatures\". In addition, the\\n\"Climate Change Working Group on Infrastructure\" has shared its experience and studies\\nfindings with public organizations and utilities through relevant government departments,\\nhelping enhance the overall resilience of infrastructure across society.\\nThe CEDD launched the \"Landslip Prevention and Mitigation Programme\" in 2010. Adopting\\na \"risk-based\" approach, the programme systematically and continuously manages landslides\\nrisks for natural hillsides and man-made slopes. The CEDD prioritizes actions based on\\nfactors such as the size, gradient, geological and hydrological conditions of man-made slopes\\nand natural hillsides, as well as the occurrence of recent landslides, and the potential impact\\non nearby facilities in the event of a landslides (e.g. proximity to existing buildings and\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n279\\ncritical transport corridors). These actions include the stabilization of government man-made\\nslopes, safety screening studies for private man-made slopes, and risk mitigation works for\\nnatural hillsides. In 2022, the CEDD initiated the study of \"Shoreline Management Plan\" to\\nprovide guidelines on coastal planning and formulate long-term strategies and preventive\\nmeasures to enhance the capacity of the government and relevant stakeholders to address\\nclimate change.\\nAdditionally, the DSD has been continuously reviewing the stormwater drainage master plans\\nfor various districts across Hong Kong, with the aim of assessing the flood discharge capacity\\nof stormwater drainage systems and the flooding risks under climate change. It has also\\nallocated resources to implement improvement works for stormwater drainage systems. The\\nDSD has also initiated the \"Flood Management Strategy Planning Study to Address Sea Level\\nRise and Extreme Rainfall\", with the aim of developing flood management strategies to\\naddress sea level rise and extreme rainfall, thereby enhancing Hong Kong\\'s flood resilience\\nand taking proactive measures.\\nIn terms of water resources, in face of the challenges of climate change and increasing fresh\\nwater demand due to population and economic growth, the Water Supplies Department has\\nincluded climate change adaptation into its water resources management strategy since 2008\\nto ensure water security and support for sustainable development in Hong Kong. The strategy\\nwith emphasis on containing fresh water demand growth, including promotion of water\\nconservation, adoption of smart technologies to enhance the implementation of water loss\\nmanagement initiatives, expansion of use of lower grade water (viz. seawater and recycled\\nwater) for non-potable purposes, and building resilience in the fresh water supply to cope\\nwith extreme droughts and safeguard water supply reliability by constructing desalination\\nplants.\\n\\nThe \"Guangdong-Hong Kong Joint Working Group on Environmental Protection and\\nCombating Climate Change\" conducts consultation and coordination on issues related to\\nenvironmental quality, natural resources, ecological environment, climate change response\\nand sustainable development in Guangdong and Hong Kong. The \"Special Panel on\\nCombating Climate Change \" (SPCCC) is responsible for advancing exchanges, cooperation\\nand scientific research on climate change mitigation and adaptation, conducting and\\nfollowing up on cooperation and exchange programs concerning issues of mutual concern,\\npromoting the exchange and enhancement of collaboration on extreme climate event\\nmonitoring and prediction to jointly advance capacity building for climate change adaptation\\nin both regions, facilitating research in meteorology, improve disaster management and\\ncontingency planning in Guangdong and Hong Kong and advancing public education on\\nclimate change adaptation and strengthening institutional capacity in both regions. The key\\nwork of the \"SPCCC\" includes exchanging information in the following areas: progress of\\nresearch on strategies and pathways to achieve carbon peaking and carbon neutrality, the\\ndevelopment of carbon trading and carbon markets, renewable energy technologies and\\nprojects, re-calibration devices and technologies for existing buildings, new energy vehicle\\ntechnologies and developments, Guangdong\\'s experience in carbon-inclusive initiatives,\\nPart V Information of HKSAR on Climate Change\\n280\\nconservation efforts in natural reserves of both regions, strengthening research on sea level\\nrise, urban drainage system and slope safety management, water resource management\\nstrategies, and the latest research developments in the fields related to climate change and\\nhuman health, as well as ongoing cooperation in the development of short-term climate\\nforecasting technologies.\\nIn addition, the Environmental Protection Department, in collaboration with the then\\nEconomic and Information Technology Commission of Guangdong Provincial (now known\\nas the Department of Industry and Information Technology of Guangdong Province),\\nlaunched the \"Cleaner Production Partnership Programme\" in 2008 to facilitate Hong Kong-\\nowned factories located in both Hong Kong and Guangdong Province in adopting cleaner\\nproduction technologies and practices. Through cleaner production, factories can enhance\\ntheir environmental performance while reducing raw material consumption and saving energy.\\nThis not only lowers production costs but also increases competitiveness, thereby improving\\nprofitability and generating economic benefits. Since the launch of the programme, the\\nHKSAR Government has invested approximately HK$ 293 million. In view of the\\nenvironmental benefits brought by the programme, the Government allocated an additional\\nHK$ 311 million in 2020 to extend the programme for another five years until March 31,\\n2025.\\n\\nIn addition to potentially affecting the distribution and survival of wildlife populations within\\nhabitats, climate change may also increase the risk of wildfires, resulting in the destruction of\\nwooded areas, soil erosion, and impacts on forest coverage and ecological functions. The\\nwoodlands within Hong Kong\\'s country parks and special areas play a vital role in combating\\nclimate change. AFCD will continue to properly manage and protect these habitats to enhance\\ntheir resilience to climate change.\\nThe approximately 2,000 hectares of wetlands in the Mai Po and Inner Deep Bay areas of\\nHong Kong, including mangroves, gei wai (tidal shrimp ponds), fishponds and reed beds, are\\nvital habitats for combating climate change and enhancing climate resilience. Therefore,\\nwetland conservation is also crucial for coping with extreme weather. AFCD will continue to\\nenhance the quality of wetland habitats and promote the sustainable use of wetland natural\\nresources to maintain the ecological environment and functions of important wetlands.\\nFurthermore, it plans to establish a wetland conservation parks system in the Northern\\nMetropolis to further safeguard the ecosystem security of these wetland habitats.\\nIn 2021, the CEDD completed a study on the effectiveness and feasibility of eco-shorelines.\\nThis innovative environmental technology involves using artificial ecological components to\\nsimulate microhabitats of natural coasts on man-made seawalls, aiming to enhance the\\nbiodiversity of water bodies. The application of eco-shorelines has already been extended to\\nmultiple areas.

With reference to the IPCC AR6 Report\\nand the related research on latest climate change, the CEDD updated the design parameters in\\nthe Part Words Design Manual in August 2022, taking into account the impacts of wind speed\\nincrease, storm surge increase, and sea-level rise on coastal infrastructure due to climate\\nchange. To strengthen the ability of coastal areas to withstand heightened waves, the CEDD\\ncompleted the \"Coastal Hazards Study\" in 2021. This study assessed the likelihood and\\nseverity of coastal hazards in these areas and, with reference to the records of past coastal\\ndamage caused by super typhoons, identified 26 low-lying or windy residential areas with\\nhigher potential risk, and also recommended the implementation of improvement works and\\nmanagement measures. The CEDD commenced the design for the relevant improvement\\nworks in 2022 and plans to complete these works in a timely and orderly manner within five\\nyears (by 2027).\\nCombating extreme rainstorms. With reference to the IPCC AR6 Report and the related\\nresearch on recent climate change conducted by relevant departments, the DSD updated the\\ndesign parameters in the Stormwater Drainage Manual in August 2022, addressing the\\nimpacts of increased rainfall and sea level rise on drainage systems due to climate change.\\nThe DSD has adopted a \"three-pronged flood prevention strategy\" (i.e. stormwater\\ninterception at upstream, flood storage at midstream, and drainage improvement at\\ndownstream) to formulate appropriate flood prevention and drainage management measures.\\nOver the years, the DSD has completed numerous major flood control projects, including\\nfour stormwater drainage tunnels, four flood storage schemes, and the improvement of over\\n100 kilometers of river channels. With the completion of several major flood control projects,\\nflooding issues in many areas have been significantly alleviated. The number of flooding\\nblackspots has also been significantly reduced, with a total of 127 flooding blackspots\\neliminated to date.\\nCombating landslide risks. The CEDD continues to implement the \"Landslip Prevention and\\nMitigation Programme\", adopting a risk-based approach to stabilize government man-made\\nslopes and carry out risk mitigation works for natural hillsides. The CEDD will also enhance\\nthe technical design requirements for slope drainage to strengthen the ability of slopes to\\nwithstand extreme rainstorms.\\nCombating extreme heat. The HKSAR Government will continue to promote green building\\ndesign and sustainable building environment, and advance urban forestry to mitigate and\\ncope with temperature rise.\\nPart V Information of HKSAR on Climate Change\\n282\\n\\nThe HKSAR Government has developed the Natural Disaster Contingency Plan, which\\nclarifies the strategies, organizational structure and warning systems for responding to natural\\ndisasters, as well as the functions and responsibilities of government decision-making\\nbureaus/departments, utility companies and non-governmental organizations in the event of a\\nnatural disaster. In the event of a super typhoon or other large-scale natural disasters, the\\nHKSAR Government will establish an inter-departmental steering committee led by the Chief\\nSecretary for Administration and composed of principal officials. This committee will\\nprovide high-level coordination and oversight during the preparation, response and recovery\\nphases, and set priorities for various tasks to enable citizens to quickly return to normal life.\\nIf a natural disaster causes extreme and widespread impacts, such as extensive flooding,\\nsevere landslides, or significant disruptions to public transportation services, the steering\\ncommittee will consider declaring an \"extreme situation\" to advise citizens to remain in their\\ncurrent safe locations.\\nUnder the current storm surge warning system, the government has established an early alert\\nsystem. Relevant departments will deploy emergency response teams to assist residents in\\nlow-lying coastal areas, including handling flooding and installing water baffles and sandbags\\nin specific locations, all aimed at reducing the impact of seawater inundation on local\\nresidents.\\nThe DSD began implementing the \"just-in-time clearance\" arrangement in 2020. Before the\\nonset of a rainstorm, the DSD will deploy teams in advance to inspect areas prone to\\nblockage, allowing for quick clearance arrangements to reduce the risk of flooding. In\\naddition, whenever a red or black rainstorm warning signal, or a tropical cyclone warning\\nsignal No. 8 or higher is issued, the DSD will activate the Emergency Control Center to\\ndispatch emergency response teams to handle flooding incidents and clear blocked channels\\nand river courses urgently. After a heavy rainstorm, the DSD will inspect the drainage\\nchannels, river courses and waterways, and carry out desilting operations if necessary to\\nprepare for the next rainstorm. The CEDD provides 24-hour emergency services throughout\\nthe year. When handling emergency incidents related to landslides, it offers geotechnical\\nadvice and ensures that necessary emergency slope stabilization measures are implemented as\\nsoon as possible, so as to reduce the impact of landslides on citizens and enable them to\\nreturn to normal life as quickly as possible.\\nTo facilitate real-time communication of disaster-related incident information among\\ngovernment departments, assisting in assessing the situation and developing response plans\\nand measures for natural disasters, the “Common Operational Pictures” covers incident\\ninformation related to landslides, flooding, storm surges and other disasters.

The HKSAR Government will continue to\\ndevelop adaptation policies and plans based on the latest developments in climate science and\\nrelevant international standards, including the assessment reports published by the United\\nNations IPCC, projections of Hong Kong\\'s temperature and rainfall, as well as future changes\\nin average sea levels. These efforts aim to enhance the city\\'s adaptation and resilience\\ncapabilities. Stakeholders from all sectors also need to cooperate in implementing relevant\\nadaptation and response measures for their properties and facilities, in order to reduce the\\nimpacts and losses caused by extreme weather.\\n\\n\\nIn October 2007, HKSAR joined the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40) under the\\ncity identity of \"Hong Kong, China\". In May 2011, it became a member of the C40 Steering\\nCommittee, promoting collective efforts among major cities worldwide to address climate\\nchange. To establish closer partnerships with C40 cities in the Asia and Oceania regions, the\\nEnvironment and Ecology Bureau hosted the first C40 Climate Action Seminar (Asia and\\nOceania regions) on October 27, 2023. The seminar brought together representatives from 15\\nC40 Cities cities in Asia and Oceania regions to share their climate action initiatives,\\nincluding the promotion of green transport and infrastructure, and the development of green\\neconomy and finance.

In addition, climate change has led to the ongoing rise in sea levels, which\\nmay pose a threat to some low-lying areas in the future. In response to the increasing\\nfrequency of extreme weather events, the HKSAR Government must strengthen key public\\ninfrastructure facilities, enhance coastal protection, and continue to improve the city\\'s flood\\nresilience and reinforce slopes, in preparation for more frequent extreme weather in the future.\\nHong Kong has accumulated experience in combating extreme weather events such as\\ntropical cyclones and rainstorms. It has established a solid foundation in strengthening the\\ndesign of buildings and infrastructure, enhancing drainage management and prevention of\\nlandslides. The public is increasingly concerned about the impacts of climate change and\\nsupports the HKSAR Government in allocating more public resources to implement measures\\nfor climate change adaptation. As technologies and methods for climate change adaptation\\ncontinue to evolve, related projects can not only enhance the ability to withstand extreme\\nweather but also beautify the environment. For example, the concept of revitalizing water\\nbodies by incorporating greening and ecological conservation elements in drainage projects\\nallows for effective drainage while promoting greening, protecting biodiversity and\\nbeautifying the environment.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe promotion of a low-carbon transition around the world and the growing environmental\\nawareness among the public are leading to the development of a green economy. For example,\\napplication of new energy, energy efficiency and green buildings, new energy vehicles and\\nother green industries are creating new investment and employment opportunities. In the\\nprocess of achieving carbon neutrality in Hong Kong, the HKSAR Government and all\\nsectors of society will invest substantial financial resources for planning and implementation\\nin promoting measures such as energy saving, clean\\nenergy, green infrastructure,\\nelectrification of transportation, and waste reduction and recycling. These efforts will not\\nonly help sustainably improve environmental quality, but will also create opportunities in\\ngreen economy on many fronts.\\nStatistics indicate that in the next 30 years, the Asia region alone will need US$66 trillion in\\nclimate investment, highlighting the huge market demand for green finance. Hong Kong\\'s\\ngreen and sustainable finance market has been flourishing. In 2022, the total amount of green\\nand sustainable debt issued in Hong Kong (including bonds and loans) increased by over 40%\\ncompared to 2021, reaching US$ 80.5 billion. Among them, the amount of green and\\nsustainable bonds issued in Hong Kong accounted for 35% of the green and sustainable bond\\nmarket in Asia. Under the \"Government Green Bond Programme\", the HKSAR Government\\nhas successfully issued a total of approximately US$ 25 billion in government green bonds\\nsince May 2019.

DSMG is responsible for\\ncoordination, greenhouse gas accounting, and carbon neutrality research. The Environmental\\nProtection Bureau is the public agency in MSAR responsible for researching, planning,\\nimplementing, coordinating, and promoting environmental and energy policies, helping\\ndevelop MSAR\\'s environmental and energy policies. The Transport Bureau is responsible for\\nstudying, planning, promoting, and implementing MSAR’s land transport policies, while the\\nCivil Aviation Authority promotes the low-carbon development of MSAR’s civil aviation\\nsector.\\n\\n\\nTo achieve the core goals of the Paris Agreement, the MSAR Government has been actively\\npromoting climate change mitigation efforts, including further reducing carbon emissions\\nfrom local power generation and increasing the share of clean electricity imports, enhancing\\nenergy efficiency in buildings, and improving public transport and urban rail systems.\\nAdditionally, the government has completed the Research on Macao’s Determined\\nContribution on Climate Change and Long-Term GHG Low Emission Development Strategy,\\nto effectively implement carbon peaking and carbon neutrality efforts in the MSAR. To align\\nwith the national autonomous emission reduction targets, the MSAR Government set carbon\\nintensity reduction targets for 2020 and 2030. Furthermore, in the Second Five-Year Plan for\\nEconomic and Social Development of the Macao Special Administrative Region (2021–2025),\\nthe government proposed to achieve carbon peaking by 2030 or earlier.\\n\\n The MSAR Government set a target to reduce carbon\\nintensity by 40%-45% by 2020 compared to 2005. In 2021, Macao further proposed an\\nenhanced target for climate change action: by 2030, reducing carbon intensity by 60%-65%\\nPart VI Information of MSAR on Climate Change\\n304\\ncompared to 2005.\\n\\n\\n The carbon intensity tracking indicator measures\\nCO₂ equivalent emissions per unit of GDP, with units of tons of CO₂ equivalent per million\\nMOP. This indicator is influenced by factors such as MSAR\\'s economic growth, energy\\nconsumption, and energy structure. The numerator is the carbon emission indicator, primarily\\nbased on MSAR\\'s annual greenhouse gas inventory data, while the denominator is MSAR\\'s\\nyear-on-year GDP. The base year for the carbon intensity indicator is 2005.\\n\\n To achieve the carbon intensity reduction target, the MSAR Government\\nhas continuously implemented measures in recent years, including promoting low-carbon\\npower generation, electric vehicles, green public transport, and adding green building\\nrequirements to public construction projects. Furthermore, the government has encouraged\\nemissions reduction in the hotel industry through the Macao Green Hotel Award. As of 2020,\\ncarbon intensity was reduced by 41.6% compared to 2005, meeting the target of a 40%-45%\\nreduction.\\n After reaching the 2020 target, MSAR\\'s carbon\\nintensity further decreased in 2021, down 52.5% from 2005. However, due to the impact of\\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, MSAR\\'s GDP fell sharply in 2022, leading to a temporary increase\\nin carbon intensity. In 2022, carbon intensity rose compared to 2021 but remained 35.2%\\nlower than in 2005. As MSAR\\'s economy gradually recovers, the 2023 GDP is expected to\\nrebound, with carbon intensity projected to be 40%-50% lower than in 2005.\\n\\nNearly 90% of MSAR\\'s electricity consumption comes from the China Southern Power Grid,\\nmaking the power supply highly dependent on imports and causing fluctuations that pose\\nchallenges for measuring and tracking local actual carbon emissions. For example, GHG\\nemissions rose in 2022 compared to 2021, mainly due to a 40% increase in local power\\ngeneration.\\nMSAR\\'s pillar industries are highly susceptible to external influences, and the carbon\\nemission fluctuations caused by economic changes make real-time tracking challenging.\\nBetween 2020 and 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic led to slower economic growth in Macao,\\nwith GHG emissions showing year-to-year fluctuations, complicating the tracking and\\ncomparison of emissions data. For example, the number of flights at Macao International\\nAirport dropped significantly between 2020-2022. Comparing to 2018, there was a decrease\\nin the number of flights in 2022. Even though there were less flights but the airport still\\nrequired basic energy use (especially electricity) for daily operations, leading to a higher per-\\nflight carbon emission in 2021 and 2022 compared to 2018.\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n305\\n\\n\\n\\nIn terms of electricity supply, Macao has continued to increase the purchase of power from\\nthe Southern Power Grid, with a requirement in contracts that over 40% of the power comes\\nfrom non-fossil fuel sources. Additionally, MSAR has increased the share of natural gas and\\nreduced fuel oil in its power generation mix, with the share of natural gas in power generation\\nrising from 57.1% in 2020 to 93.3% in 2022. The Macao government continues to improve\\nthe natural gas pipeline network to encourage broader use of natural gas. The pipeline\\nnetwork currently covers the main areas of Cotai and is expanding on the Macao Peninsula to\\npromote natural gas use in projects such as large hotels, tourist facilities, and public housing.\\nTo promote local renewable energy development, the MSAR Government has established\\nRegulation for Safety and Installation of Solar Energy PV Interconnections and related feed-\\nin tariffs to encourage photovoltaic (PV) system installations. As of the end of 2022, seven\\ndepartments or organizations had installed PV systems and are connected to the grid for\\nelectricity sales. Simultaneously, the government is installing PV systems in social housing[73],\\ngovernment departments, and municipal facilities, and promoting smart grid development to\\noptimize MSAR\\'s energy supply structure.\\n\\nMSAR\\'s industrial sector is small; to encourage low-carbon transformation, the government\\npromotes the use of natural gas and electrification of equipment in industry. Additionally, to\\nreduce air pollution emissions in commercial and industrial sites, the Macao government has,\\nsince 2014, implemented emission standards and regulatory measures for air pollutants in key\\ncommercial and industrial locations according to the Macao Major Fixed Air Pollution\\nSource Emission Standards and Regulatory System.\\n\\nOver 90% of MSAR\\'s electricity consumption occurs within buildings, and promoting energy\\nefficiency in buildings can effectively reduce end-use energy demand and achieve emissions\\nreduction. Starting with public projects, the MSAR Government has added green building\\nelements to new buildings and has included green building requirements in construction\\nproject tender documents to improve energy efficiency in buildings. The government has also\\ncontinued to promote energy efficiency assessment plans for public departments and\\ninstitutions, encouraging energy savings and emissions reductions in buildings.\\nIn 2022, the MSAR Government released the Macao Green Building Guidelines - Public\\nHousing and Macao Green Building Guidelines - Public Buildings to provide references for\\npublic sector and industry projects in design, construction, and operation. The Second Five-\\nYear Plan for Economic and Social Development of the Macao Special Administrative Region\\n[73] Social housing refers to public housing built by the MSAR Government or developers, providing\\naffordable rental options for low-income or specially disadvantaged families.\\nPart VI Information of MSAR on Climate Change\\n306\\n(2021–2025) requires that at least 30% of open roof areas in new public housing projects be\\nallocated to PV power generation systems or vegetation coverage, gradually increasing the\\nuse of renewable energy in MSAR. The government has continued to hold the Macao Green\\nHotel Award to encourage environmental management in the hotel industry, recognizing\\nhotels that have adopted environmental management practices to encourage emissions\\nreduction and waste reduction. Additionally, in recent years, the MSAR Government has\\ninstalled PV systems at selected locations, such as the car park at Taipa Ferry Terminal\\nStation and the Macao Grand Prix Museum. A PV system has also been installed at the cross-\\nborder industrial area sewage treatment plant, which was completed and put into operation in\\nearly 2024.\\n\\nThe MSAR Government encourages green travel, including optimizing pedestrian systems\\nand improving public and urban rail transit, to guide the public toward using public\\ntransportation and walking, thereby reducing carbon emissions from private vehicle use.\\nTo lower the overall carbon emissions from vehicles, the MSAR Government leads by\\nexample in using electric vehicles and continues to promote new energy vehicles through\\nvarious measures. Specific initiatives include providing tax incentives, implementing the\\nPlan to grant financial support for the scrapping of obsolete motorbikes and their\\nreplacement with new electric motorbikes, and requiring charging capacity and infrastructure\\nin all parking spaces in new public parking lots and buildings. They also promote increased\\ncharging facilities in older public parking lots. By the end of 2022, 2,146 public light vehicle\\ncharging stations and 500 electric motorcycle charging points were installed. Additional\\nincentives encourage hotels and entertainment businesses to use new energy vehicles as\\nshuttle buses and promote the application of new energy buses.\\nThe MSAR Government will continue building a green transportation network, emphasizing\\na “public transportation priority” orientation to improve bus and pedestrian systems and\\npromote the light rail system to encourage green travel and reduce the use of private vehicles.\\nTo accelerate the electrification of vehicles in the MSAR, the Environmental Protection\\nBureau developed the Macao Electric Vehicle Promotion Plan, proposing various measures\\nfrom promoting the replacement of vehicles with electric alternatives to improving charging\\nfacilities and infrastructure, aiming for 100% of new registered light vehicles and\\nmotorcycles to be zero-emission vehicles (electric or other technology) by 2035.\\nIn terms of air transportation, the MSAR Government is committed to reducing carbon\\nemissions per flight at the airport, aiming for a 30% reduction per takeoff and landing by\\n2028 compared to 2018. They also aim to improve airport energy efficiency, replace lighting\\nsystems and environmentally friendly vehicles, implement energy management in airport\\nbuildings, and enhance waste management and recycling to reduce carbon emissions.\\n\\nDespite limited land area, the MSAR Government prioritizes ecological restoration and\\nbiodiversity maintenance. From 2020 to 2022, more than 6,000 trees were planted in parks,\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n307\\nrecreational areas, and roadside green belts (Table 6-11). Additionally, the Municipal Affairs\\nBureau completed the third phase of forest restoration, covering 15 hectares in the Hac Sa\\nReservoir Country Park and the Taipa Grande Natural Park in 2022, planting approximately\\n15,000\\nsaplings\\nand\\nimplementing\\na\\n1-hectare\\nforest\\nreconstruction\\nand\\nplanting\\napproximately 1,000 saplings in Taipa.

Measures include continuously optimizing exhaust emission\\nstandards for imported new and in-use vehicles. Currently, emission standards for imported\\nnew automobiles have been raised to the equivalent of the EU’s Stage 6 level, and standards\\nfor imported new motorcycles have been raised to the equivalent of the EU’s Stage 4 level.\\nThe MSAR Government also launched the Plan to grant financial support for the scrapping\\nof obsolete motorbikes and their replacement with new electric motorbikes in 2022 and the\\nPlan to grant financial support for the scrapping of old diesel-powered vehicles in 2023,\\nencouraging vehicle owners to accelerate the replacement of higher-pollution old diesel or\\nmotorcycle vehicles to meet “dual carbon” goals. Since 2014, the MSAR Government has\\nimplemented emission standards and regulatory measures for air pollutants in key\\ncommercial and industrial locations according to the Macao Major Fixed Air Pollution\\nSource Emission Standards and Regulatory System.\\nIn terms of solid waste management, the MSAR Government, through the Macao Solid Waste\\nResources Management Programme (2017–2026), has developed a ten-year plan for solid\\nwaste management in MSAR. They continue to promote waste reduction and recycling at the\\nsource, reducing carbon emissions from waste disposal, expanding food waste reduction, and\\nrecycling. They are also expediting the construction of an organic resource recycling center\\nfor more environmentally friendly food waste disposal, which will also generate energy from\\nwaste. The first phase of the center, with a daily processing capacity of 150 tons of food\\nwaste, is expected to be operational by 2027, generating approximately 136,000 kWh of\\nenergy for internal and external use.\\n\\n\\nTo control GHG emissions, the MSAR Government released the Second Five-Year Plan for\\nEconomic and Social Development of the Macao Special Administrative Region (2021–2025)\\nin 2021, proposing to seriously implement carbon peak and carbon neutrality efforts. The\\ngoal is to reduce the greenhouse gas emission intensity per unit of regional GDP by 55%\\nfrom 2005 levels by 2025 and to strive to achieve carbon peaking by or before 2030.\\n\\nTechnological Innovation and Regional Cooperation. The MSAR Government remains\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n309\\nfocused on new technologies related to mitigating climate change, including carbon capture\\nand storage (CCS) technology and hydrogen energy technology. In 2021-2022, the Macao\\nScience and Technology Development Fund (FDCT) approved 12 projects in the fields of\\nenvironmental and energy science and technology, with funding exceeding MOP 15 million.\\nAdditionally, the FDCT, together with the National Natural Science Foundation of China,\\njointly funded the research project Researches on metabolic mechanism of multisource solid\\nwaste and its optimization pathway of pollution and carbon reduction in Guangdong-Hong\\nKong-Macao\\nGreater\\nBay\\nArea,\\nworking\\ntogether\\nto\\nadvance\\nemission\\nreduction\\ntechnologies in the Greater Bay Area.\\nPromoting Low-Carbon Lifestyles Among the Public. For businesses and institutions, the\\nMSAR Government promotes participation in energy-saving and emission reduction\\ninitiatives through various programs, such as the Macao Green Hotel Award, the Green\\nSchool Partner Program, the Green Supermarket Commendation Program, and the Energy\\nEfficiency Assessment Program for public departments and institutions. At the same time, the\\ngovernment encourages large enterprises to fulfill their social responsibilities by conducting\\ncarbon audits, formulating their own carbon neutrality plans, and disclosing low-carbon\\ninformation to the public to promote a culture of carbon reduction among businesses and\\ninstitutions. For individuals, the MSAR Government continues to strengthen environmental\\nawareness and education, and has been formulating more incentive measures. These include\\nintegrating more low-carbon messages in various activities, enhancing the understanding of\\nteachers and students about climate change and extreme weather, and promoting awareness\\nthrough media and social platforms to guide citizens in fulfilling their obligations to save\\nenergy and reduce emissions.\\n\\nTo better formulate greenhouse gas emission reduction targets and effective policies suited to\\nthe realities of the MSAR, the MSAR Government conducted the Research on Macao’s\\nDetermined Contribution on Climate Change and Long-Term GHG Low Emission\\nDevelopment Strategy. Using evaluation model tools and considering China’s autonomous\\nemission reduction targets, this research simulated the emission reduction potential across\\nvarious sectors in Macao, including electricity, transportation, construction, and tourism. The\\nfindings provide scientific evidence for the MSAR Government’s planning and design of\\nsystems and mechanisms for greenhouse gas emission control, as well as for drafting the\\nLong-term Decarbonisation Strategy of Macao.\\nOver the years, the MSAR Government has actively promoted the concepts of environmental\\nprotection, energy conservation, and green living. By increasing the proportion of imported\\nelectricity and implementing a series of emission reduction policies and measures, initial\\nresults have been achieved. The research report MSAR Energy Efficiency Status 2021 shows\\nthat, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, overall energy consumption in MSAR\\ndecreased across some industries in 2021, although some sectors showed an increase\\ncompared to 2019.

In addition,\\nhistorical climate observation data from the MSAR, along with global climate model\\nsimulation data, have been used to assess and predict climate change in the region.\\n\\nAccording to an analysis of daily average temperature and precipitation data from 1901 to\\n2022, the characteristics of climate change in the MSAR are as follows:\\nThe temperature trends over the past 122 years in MSAR align closely with the global\\naverage temperature changes. The 100-year linear warming trend is 0.92°C, with an\\naccelerated warming rate since the 1970s. Nine of the eleven warmest years in the past 122\\nyears occurred in the 21st century. Temperatures have increased across all seasons, with the\\nmost significant rise in spring (approximately 0.108°C/decade), followed by winter (around\\n0.101°C/decade) and autumn (about 0.099°C/decade), with summer seeing the smallest\\nincrease (about 0.060°C/decade). There is a significant upward trend in both the daily\\nmaximum temperature and the daily minimum temperature, with notable inter-decadal\\nchanges in daily maximum temperature. Although the number of hot days (with daily\\nmaximum temperature over 33°C) has shown significant decadal variability, no substantial\\nincrease in hot days has been observed. However, cold nights (with daily minimum\\ntemperature of 12°C or below) and hot nights (with daily minimum temperature of 27°C or\\nabove) have shown a significant and sustained trend, with cold nights decreasing by\\napproximately 1.5 days per decade and hot nights increasing by about 2.0 days per decade.\\nThe frequency of heavy rain (more than 50 mm per day) and torrential rain (more than 100\\nmm per day) has also increased, with 100-year linear trends of 3.6 days and 1.5 days,\\nrespectively.\\nPrecipitation in the MSAR shows significant inter-decadal variations, with an overall\\nincreasing trend in the 20th century, with an average increase of approximately 38.1 mm per\\ndecade. The increase is most notable in summer, with less noticeable changes in other seasons.\\nBased on the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) definitions,\\nthe DSMG calculated various climate change indices (see Table 6-13), which reflect an\\noverall warming trend along with significant increases in precipitation intensity and the\\nmaximum consecutive 5-day precipitation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nID12\\nCold Days\\n-0.149 days\\nCD12\\nCold Nights\\n-1.52 nights\\nSU33\\nHot Days\\n0.33 days\\nTR27\\nHot Nights\\n2.01 nights\\nTXx\\nAnnual Maximum Temperature\\n0.065℃\\nTNx\\nAnnual maximum value of daily minimum temperature\\n0.053℃\\nTXn\\nAnnual minimum value of daily maximum temperature\\n0.068℃\\nTNn\\nAnnual Minimum Temperature\\n0.092℃\\nSDII\\nDaily simple precipitation intensity index\\n0.42 mm/day\\nRx5day\\nMaximum Consecutive 5-Day Precipitation\\n8.57 mm\\nPart VI Information of MSAR on Climate Change\\n316\\nBased on Macao’s historical climate data and simulation results of different GHG emission\\nscenarios and climate models from the IPCC AR6, future climate change in Macao was\\nassessed. The main conclusions are as follows: First, the average temperature in Macao will\\ncontinue to show an upward trend. Under all scenarios, by the middle of this century (2041-\\n2060), temperatures will rise by 1.18°C to 1.72°C compared to the average from 1995-2014;\\nby the end of the 21st century (2081-2100), temperatures will increase by 1.28°C to 3.69°C\\n(Table 6-14); seasonal temperatures will also show an upward trend by the end of this century\\n(Table 6-15). Second, precipitation intensity in Macao is expected to increase by the middle\\nand end of the 21st century, with the highest precipitation intensity during summer reaching\\nup to 28.22% (Table 6-16).\\n\\n\\nTemperature (°C)\\nGreenhouse Gas Emission Scenarios\\n2041–2060\\n2081–2100\\nSSP1-2.6\\n1.18\\n1.28\\nSSP2-4.5\\n1.31\\n2.10\\nSSP3-7.0\\n1.26\\n2.80\\nSSP5-8.5\\n1.72\\n3.69\\n\\nTemperature (°C) (2081–2100)\\nGreenhouse Gas Emission Scenarios\\nSpring\\nSummer\\nAutumn\\nWinter\\nSSP1-2.6\\n1.37\\n0.99\\n1.19\\n1.56\\nSSP2-4.5\\n2.19\\n1.82\\n2.12\\n2.27\\nSSP3-7.0\\n2.79\\n2.62\\n2.94\\n2.87\\nSSP5-8.5\\n3.66\\n3.37\\n3.85\\n3.89\\n\\nPrecipitation Intensity (%) (2081–2100)\\nGreenhouse Gas Emission Scenarios\\nSpring\\nSummer\\nAutumn\\nWinter\\nSSP1-2.6\\n9.38\\n8.05\\n6.21\\n8.52\\nSSP2-4.5\\n2.78\\n16.14\\n12.04\\n11.32\\nSSP3-7.0\\n1.12\\n18.06\\n16.03\\n5.41\\nSSP5-8.5\\n8.23\\n28.22\\n21.09\\n5.24\\n\\nIn the New Rainstorm Warning Signal System effective from September 1, 2020, rainstorms\\nare categorized into three levels - yellow, red, and black - based on different rainfall amounts.\\nFrom September 1, 2020, to 2022, MSAR experienced three black-level and thirteen red-\\nlevel rainstorm warnings. From 2020 to 2022, the MSAR Government activated its civil\\nprotection structure eight times in response to tropical cyclones and natural disasters. During\\nTyphoon Higos in 2020, wind speeds exceeded force 8 in most areas of MSAR, with force 12\\nwinds recorded on the cross-sea bridge. The highest 10-minute average wind speed reached\\n138.6 km/h, with peak gusts at 215.6 km/h, second only to the wind speeds recorded during\\nTyphoon Hato in 2017.\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n317\\nDuring Typhoon Higos, 15 people were injured, with three suffering moderate injuries and\\nthe rest sustaining minor injuries. The Civil Protection Center received 99 inquiries, mainly\\nrelated to customs and transportation issues, and recorded 274 incident reports. Additionally,\\nthree light rail stations (Pai Kok Station, Lotus Checkpoint Station, and West Cotai Station)\\nsuffered damage due to the storm. The Municipal Affairs Bureau conducted post-disaster\\ncleanup and restoration and managed damaged trees.\\n\\n\\nOver 98% of MSAR’s water supply originates from the Xijiang River, a tributary of the Pearl\\nRiver. The future state of water resources primarily depends on rainfall variations in the Pearl\\nRiver Basin, upstream water usage, and changes in sea level in the South China Sea.\\nAccording to national analysis, the southern rivers have shown little change in runoff over the\\npast 30 years, while MSAR’s rapid economic development has caused a sharp increase in\\nwater demand. By the end of the 21st century (2081–2100), the sea level around MSAR is\\nexpected to rise by 0.59 to 0.76 meters compared to the 1995–2014 average. Saltwater\\nintrusion during low-water periods in the Pearl River estuary is anticipated, necessitating\\nincreased measures for water security.\\n\\nIn recent decades, tropical vines in MSAR’s mountain forests have grown rapidly, covering\\nlarge areas and gradually weakening or even killing trees due to lack of photosynthesis.\\nSaplings under these canopies struggle to grow due to insufficient sunlight, preventing\\nnatural forest renewal. Invasive plant species have also disrupted forest structure and the\\ngrowth of other plants. Additionally, forest pest issues have increased, with preliminary\\nassessments suggesting that rising CO₂ levels and temperatures may be contributing factors.\\nDisentangling the effects of climate change from urbanization remains challenging. Several\\nsuper typhoons in recent years have also severely damaged MSAR’s forests.\\n\\nAs a coastal city, MSAR has its most vulnerable area along the west coast of the Macao\\nPeninsula, where the low-lying terrain is highly susceptible to sea-level rise. When strong\\ntropical cyclones approach or make landfall near the Pearl River estuary, storm surges can\\ncause serious backflow and widespread flooding, especially if they coincide with\\nastronomical tides. According to tide gauge data from 1925–2022, the average sea level in\\nMSAR has been rising by approximately 1.6 mm per year, accelerating to about 1.9 mm per\\nyear in the past 20 years. From the 1970s to the present, MSAR has experienced 16\\nsignificant storm surge events, 11 of which occurred after 2000 and 6 after 2015.\\nIn the future, both the extent and frequency of backflow flooding due to astronomical tides\\nare expected to worsen, with an increased probability of severe storm surge impacts. Climate\\nchange will also significantly reduce areas suitable for mangroves, affecting mangrove\\ngrowth in the region.\\nPart VI Information of MSAR on Climate Change\\n318\\n\\n\\n\\nNot involved.\\n\\nClimate disasters may make waste cleanup challenging, damage the living environment, and\\nsignificantly increase the risk of infectious disease outbreaks in MSAR, especially digestive\\ntract and mosquito-borne diseases.\\n\\nTyphoons and coastal flooding can cause severe flooding in low-lying areas, impacting\\ninfrastructure and major projects in these regions. During Typhoon Hato, flooding levels in\\nInner Harbor were between 1–2 meters, while the central area of Coloane reached nearly 1\\nmeter. The cargo terminal in Inner Harbor and nearby businesses were completely flooded,\\ndamaging all goods. Flooding can also disrupt basic infrastructure like electricity, water, and\\ncommunication, impacting residents’ lives and making disaster response and recovery more\\nchallenging.\\n\\nMeteorological disasters like typhoons can damage municipal facilities, cause tree collapse,\\nand disrupt transportation, affecting daily life. During Typhoon Hato, about 9,000 trees in\\nMSAR were toppled, and municipal facilities like parks, recreational areas, libraries, and\\nexhibition venues suffered severe damage. Around 80 flights were canceled, 30 flights were\\ndelayed, and 440 passengers were stranded at the airport.\\n\\nTourism, a pillar industry in MSAR, is highly sensitive to climate change. Typhoons and\\ncoastal flooding can directly halt tourism and indirectly cause industry losses. During\\nTyphoon Hato, power outages and varying degrees of flooding impacted many parts of\\nMSAR, affecting large tour groups and closing some hotels and gaming venues, causing\\nsignificant economic losses.\\nAs a city with numerous cultural heritage sites, MSAR’s traditional buildings are also\\nvulnerable to climate and related secondary disasters, with some buildings exhibiting salt\\ndamage, condensation, and biological growth. Indoor environmental conditions in some\\nactively used buildings will be increasingly challenging to maintain.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n319\\nThe MSAR government has been actively exploring technology for climate change\\nmonitoring and early warnings. MSAR has an extensive atmospheric and marine observation\\nnetwork, which includes 17 automatic weather stations, 1 climate observation station, 2\\natmospheric radiation monitoring stations, 6 air quality monitoring stations, and 2 tide\\nmonitoring stations. Due to issues of storm surges and astronomical tide backflows, MSAR\\nincreased the number of automatic water level monitoring stations in low-lying western\\ncoastal areas to 20 in 2020, allowing for monitoring of coastal water levels and flooding\\nconditions. The DSMG has optimized its flood warning services, focusing on rainfall,\\nastronomical tides, and storm surges, and introduced AI to enhance early warning capabilities.\\n\\nThe bureau is developing capabilities according to the Meteorological Development Plan for\\nthe Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (2020 – 2035), According to the\\nplanning requirements, by 2025 MSAR will establish a modern meteorological service\\nsystem, cooperative framework, technological innovation system, and comprehensive disaster\\nprevention and mitigation system in partnership with the Greater Bay Area (GBA). By 2035,\\nthis collaborative framework will develop into a world-leading modern system for\\nmeteorological services, innovation, and management across the GBA. The establishment of\\nthe relevant system will help Macao to better cope with the frequent extreme weather events\\nin the future and reduce its impact.\\n\\nMSAR has strengthened its emphasis on climate adaptation in high-level planning documents.\\nThe Outline Development Plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area\\nreleased in 2019 emphasized proactive adaptation to climate change and outlined specific\\nmeasures for water security, disaster prevention, and ecosystem protection. The Macao\\'s\\nUrban Development Master Plan (2020-2040) released in 2022aims to strengthen MSAR’s\\nresilience to increasingly complex and variable environmental challenges, such as climate\\nand economic changes. It emphasizes the need to improve the city’s shelter and rescue\\nsystems to enhance disaster prevention, mitigation, and response capabilities in extreme\\nclimate events.\\n\\nIn water resource security, the Specialized Plans on Ensuring the Safety of the Water Supply\\nto Macao and Zhuhai, approved by the State Council in 2008, has led to cooperation between\\nMSAR and Zhuhai, resulting in projects like the Zhuyin Reservoir, Zhuzhoutou Pump Station,\\nand the Pinggang-Guangchang raw water supply security project. These facilities have\\nsignificantly stabilized Zhuhai’s water supply to MSAR and improved resilience. The\\nMSAR-Zhuhai Water Resource Security Project is also planning additional infrastructure,\\nincluding phase two of Zhuyin Reservoir, Qianwu Reservoir expansion, and the new\\nBainikeng Reservoir, designed to withstand a 100-year flood, with a total capacity increase of\\n101 million cubic meters.\\nIn ecosystem protection, the Macao Environmental Protection Plan (2021–2025) focuses on\\nPart VI Information of MSAR on Climate Change\\n320\\necological restoration, urban greening, marine protection, and coastal area management. In\\n2018, the Municipal Affairs Bureau began mountain forest restoration after typhoon damage,\\ntargeting a restoration area of at least 120 hectares by 2024. The third phase in 2022 included\\n15 hectares at Hac Sa Reservoir Natural Park and Taipa Grande Natural Park, where 15,000\\nseedlings were planted. Regular monitoring and protection of mangroves have improved the\\ngrowth environment of mangroves along the coastal beaches , ensuring the species diversity\\nof the beach ecosystem. Between 2020 and 2022, forest restructuring covered four hectares,\\nwith 4,000 seedlings planted, over 12,000 mangrove seedlings added, and 6,000 city trees\\nplanted. Monitoring of extreme events’ effects on ecosystems is to be strengthened. Before a\\nsevere typhoon, trees are rapidly inspected, and after Typhoon Higos in 2020, post-storm\\nassessments were conducted to gauge wild plants’ damage levels. Tree species that are\\ndrought-, wind-, or flood-resistant are prioritized for planting, and support structures are\\ninstalled and regularly adjusted for trees in coastal or high-wind locations.\\n\\nThe MSAR Government has improved the urban drainage system through upgrades,\\nexpansions, and new construction projects, effectively mitigating waterlogging issues. The\\nInner Harbor North Pump Station and box culvert were completed in 2021. From 2020 to\\n2023, the government implemented the optimisation plan of the drainage network in San Kio\\ndistrict for flood relief in stages and continues to plan similar projects in other regions.\\nMechanisms for flood pump station staffing and coordination during extreme weather have\\nbeen established to ensure pump stations function effectively. Greenbelts are being created\\nalong public streets and walkways to assist with water drainage and storage.\\nConsidering that the post-disaster environment is conducive to the occurrence and spread of\\ninfectious diseases, the Macau Health Bureau has prepared contingency plans for the\\nmonitoring and prevention of food- and waterborne diseases after natural disasters, as well as\\na response plan for dengue fever outbreaks, which are regularly reviewed and updated.In the\\nRequirements of Basic Academic Attainments of Local Education System, students are\\nrequired to understand the impacts of climate change and disaster responses. Since 2019, the\\nMSAR government has offered a Financial Support Plan for Subscription of Property\\nInsurance against Major Disasters for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises to provide\\ncoverage for commercial property losses caused by severe weather.\\n\\nIn 2019, the MSAR Government announced the 10-Year Plan for Disaster Prevention and\\nMitigation of the Macao Special Administrative Region (2019-2028), which assessed the\\nprimary risks and challenges MSAR faces in areas such as natural disasters, accidents, public\\nhealth events, and social security incidents. This plan identified priority areas for future\\nemergency response capacity building in MSAR, setting 9 key objectives and 37 indicators to\\nreflect improvements in disaster prevention, mitigation, and emergency response capabilities\\nover the next decade. Key priorities include enhancing infrastructure resilience, improving\\nemergency management systems, strengthening risk management and early warning\\ncapabilities, and improving social coordination in emergency response. These measures aim\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n321\\nto address potential exacerbations in extreme weather and water resource shortages due to\\nclimate change, and to strengthen MSAR’s overall climate resilience.\\nThe Second Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development of the Macao Special\\nAdministrative Region (2021–2025), released in 2021, highlights the need for orderly\\nimplementation of the disaster prevention and mitigation plan, emphasizing the creation of a\\nrobust urban safety management system. This involves establishing a civil protection system\\nled by the government with active social participation to improve disaster response efficiency.\\nThe plan also emphasizes periodic reviews and revisions to the Civil Protection General Plan.\\nSystem functionalities of the “Emergency Command Application Platform” are to be\\nupgraded, and efforts will continue to stockpile disaster preparedness supplies. The Storm\\nSurge Evacuation Plan in Low-lying Areas during Typhoon will continue to be implemented,\\nalong with recruiting and training civil protection volunteers. Public awareness campaigns\\nwill be conducted to raise risk awareness and encourage disaster self-help among residents.\\nAdditionally, MSAR hosts an annual large-scale civil protection exercise, Crystal Fish Civil\\nProtection Drill, to strengthen departmental disaster response coordination and enhance the\\ngeneral public’s disaster preparedness and emergency response awareness.\\nThe Macao\\'s Urban Development Master Plan (2020-2040) released in 2022 aims to\\nstrengthen MSAR’s resilience to increasingly complex and variable environmental challenges,\\nsuch as climate and economic changes. It emphasizes the need to improve the city’s shelter\\nand rescue systems to enhance disaster prevention, mitigation, and response capabilities in\\nextreme climate events.\\n\\nCurrently, research on climate change impacts and adaptation strategies for the MSAR is\\nrelatively limited, especially in assessing future vulnerabilities. Current studies are primarily\\nbased on the Greater Bay Area or the Pearl River Basin, resulting in limited directly\\napplicable scientific support for MSAR’s decision-making. There is a need to encourage\\nmore research, especially from local researchers, on related issues. Due to the diverse range\\nof departments involved in climate adaptation, the MSAR established a cross-departmental\\nworking group on climate change, which has already yielded some progress. However, there\\nremains a need for further improvements in cross-departmental coordination on climate\\nadaptation.\\n\\n\\n\\nMSAR actively participates in climate change-related governance activities. MSAR has long\\nbeen a member of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the\\nPacific\\n(ESCAP)/World\\nMeteorological\\nOrganization\\n(WMO)\\nTyphoon\\nCommittee,\\nparticipating\\nin various committee working\\ngroup\\nmeetings,\\nexchanging the latest\\nmeteorological,\\nhydrological,\\nand\\ndisaster\\nprevention\\ntechnologies\\nand\\napplication\\ninformation. In 2022, MSAR received the Typhoon Committee’s 2022 Dr. Kintanar Award.\\nPart VI Information of MSAR on Climate Change\\n322\\nMSAR also participates in the World Meteorological Congress, the Forum on Regional\\nClimate Monitoring-Assessment-Prediction for Asia, Meeting of the Asia-Pacific Regional\\nMeteorological Subgroup on Air Navigation Planning and Implementation and other\\ninternational forums. Through international exchanges, MSAR strengthens its capacity for\\nweather and disaster monitoring and early warning.\\nMSAR serves as a platform for establishing a regular exchange mechanism between China\\nand\\nPortuguese-speaking\\ncountries’\\nmeteorological\\nagencies.\\nAccording\\nto\\nthe\\nMeteorological Development Plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area\\n(2020 – 2035), MSAR will sign meteorological science and technology cooperation\\nagreements with Portuguese-speaking countries. This cooperation, supported by the\\nESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee Secretariat, aims to establish long-term strategic\\npartnerships, promoting collaborative projects in numerical weather forecasting, severe\\nweather early warning, and public meteorological services with Portuguese-speaking\\ncountries, fostering innovation in science and technology, and supporting talent development\\nto advance meteorological technology and services.\\n\\nFollowing the 2017 Typhoon Hato, MSAR collaborated closely with experts from China’s\\nNational Disaster Reduction Committee to form the Commission for Reviewing and\\nMonitoring the Improvements of the Response Mechanism to Major Disasters. Based on\\nlessons learned from Typhoon Hato, MSAR is working to establish a modernized disaster\\nprevention and reduction system led by the SAR Government and involving diverse societal\\nparticipation. MSAR continues to strengthen cooperation with neighboring regions in\\nChinese mainland, updating emergency plans, improving infrastructure, and enhancing early\\nwarning systems. Through these efforts, MSAR has significantly reduced losses caused by\\ntyphoons. Comparing MSAR’s three strongest typhoons since 1968 - Typhoon Hato (2017),\\nTyphoon Mangkhut (2018), and Typhoon Higos (2020) - the economic loss from Typhoon\\nHato reached MOP 8.31 billion with an indirect loss of MOP 3.16 billion, resulting in 10\\ndeaths and 244 injuries. After implementing response measures, losses from Typhoon\\nMangkhut the following year decreased to a direct economic loss of MOP 691 million and an\\nindirect loss of MOP 1.045 billion, with 40 people injured. When Typhoon Higos hit, further\\nreductions in losses occurred, with 15 people injured.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe MSAR Government has established a Climate Change Group responsible for\\ncoordinating work related to commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention\\non Climate Change (UNFCCC), including developing measurable, reportable, and verifiable\\nmitigation actions. The goal is to promote climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts\\nwithin both private institutions and the general public, encouraging widespread participation\\nin climate change action.\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n323\\nThis chapter outlines the financial, technical, and capacity-building requirements for climate\\nresponse in MSAR, covering both mitigation and adaptation aspects. Financial requirements\\nrelate primarily to future investments in projects aimed at mitigating and adapting to climate\\nchange in MSAR, with estimates based on the overall investment scales of similar existing\\nprojects. Technical needs are identified based on the technologies required to support\\nMSAR’s future low-carbon transformation. Capacity-building needs to involve developing\\ninstitutional capacities to formulate and implement national policies effectively, advancing\\nclimate change objectives through specific actions, which may include capacity building for\\ninstitutions, human resource development, education, and training.\\n\\n\\nThe MSAR Government’s Long-term Decarbonisation Strategy of Macao outlines six key\\nstrategies: building a low-carbon power system, green transformation of land transport,\\nenergy conservation and clean energy substitution, waste reduction and waste-to-energy,\\ncommunity-wide\\nlow-carbon\\npractices,\\nand\\ntechnological\\ninnovation\\nwith\\nregional\\ncooperation. A summary of project costs within MSAR’s low-carbon transition pathway can\\nbe found in Table 6-17. These costs primarily cover energy, construction, and transportation\\nsectors. Findings indicate that from 2021 to 2030, cumulative funding needs for projects\\nlisted in the table will be approximately CNY 3.847 billion, with an annual average of CNY\\n385 million. Of this, mitigation funding needs are estimated at CNY 2.902 billion, or about\\nCNY 290 million per year. The table lists project funding needs primarily for the energy,\\nconstruction, and transportation sectors; adaptation funding needs amount to CNY 945\\nmillion, with an average annual need of approximately CNY 94.48 million. As climate\\nchange risks grow, adaptation funding for MSAR is expected to increase.\\n For local power generation, the MSAR\\nGovernment will further increase the proportion of natural gas generation in local power\\nplants, aiming for 100% eventually. The government is also exploring carbon capture and\\nstorage (CCS) technologies to achieve deep carbon reduction and is assessing the feasibility\\nof hydrogen power generation in the long term. Additionally, more photovoltaic systems will\\nbe installed in suitable locations, waste-to-energy technologies will be promoted, and the\\ndevelopment of smart grids will be supported, continuously optimizing MSAR’s energy\\nsupply structure. Regarding purchased electricity, the supplementary agreement on the\\nelectricity cooperation framework between the Macau SAR Government and China Southern\\nPower Grid will expire in 2026. The two parties will renegotiate the electricity costs and the\\nproportion of non-fossil energy in purchased electricity generation before the supplementary\\nagreement expires, with the goal of achieving 100% non-fossil energy power generation by\\n2050 or earlier.\\n The MSAR Government is prioritizing\\npublic transport. Measures include enhancing public transport and pedestrian systems,\\nadvancing the light rail network, encouraging green travel, and reducing private vehicle use.\\nTo promote the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), multiple measures have been proposed,\\nPart VI Information of MSAR on Climate Change\\n324\\nsuch as replacing conventional vehicles with EVs, enhancing charging infrastructure, and\\nensuring long-term support for EV adoption. By 2035, MSAR aims for 100% zero-emission\\nregistration for new light vehicles and motorcycles (using electric or other clean\\ntechnologies).\\n In the short to\\nmedium term, the government plans to increase the use of natural gas in commercial,\\nindustrial, and residential areas, expanding the gas pipeline network to replace LPG for\\nheating and cooking. MSAR will also advocate for high-efficiency appliances in commercial\\nand residential sectors and raise the electrification rate of user equipment. The MSAR\\nGovernment is starting from public projects, adding green building elements to new buildings,\\nand studying the pilot plan of energy-saving renovation of existing buildings, aiming at\\nimproving the energy efficiency of buildings through better insulation and high-efficiency\\nproducts, providing practical experience for the industry, and will continue to encourage all\\nkinds of public and private buildings to obtain green building certification.\\n The MSAR Government is expanding food waste\\nreduction and recycling and is constructing an organic resource recovery center to scale up\\nenergy recovery from waste. The center, expected to begin operations in 2027, will have an\\ninitial daily processing capacity of 150 tons of food waste, enabling energy recovery for its\\nown use and potential distribution.\\n The government will continue to engage businesses\\nand institutions through programs like the MSAR Green Hotel Award, Green School\\nPartnership Program, Green Supermarket Award Program, and Energy Efficiency Assessment\\nProgram for Public Departments and Agencies, encouraging the industry to participate in\\nenergy conservation and emission reduction. Large enterprises will be further encouraged to\\nfulfill social responsibilities by conducting carbon audits, developing carbon-neutral plans,\\nand publicly disclosing low-carbon information to foster a low-carbon culture among\\nbusinesses and institutions. For individuals, MSAR will strengthen environmental education,\\nexplore incentive measures, and use media and social platforms to promote awareness and\\nencourage responsible actions for energy conservation, emission reduction, waste separation\\nand recycling.\\n The government is also exploring\\nnew technologies, including the feasibility of applying CCS technology to local power\\ngeneration units and researching hydrogen energy applications in land transport and power\\ngeneration. Large enterprises or qualified organizations will be encouraged to lead by\\nadopting low-carbon or green technologies. Given MSAR’s limited land resources and skilled\\ntechnical personnel, the government will actively pursue collaboration with international and\\nregional partners to leverage advanced practices and technology to enhance local resilience to\\nclimate challenges. The private sector is also encouraged to draw on global best practices in\\ngreen transformation, introduce innovative mechanisms and technologies, conduct carbon\\naudits for key enterprises, and capitalize on transition opportunities.\\n MSAR is considering expanding recycled water usage to\\nThe People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Change\\n325\\nreduce water consumption. There is also a need to predict and monitor sea-level rise and\\nassess its potential threats to MSAR. Enhanced flood control infrastructure and an upgraded\\ndrainage system will be necessary in certain areas to mitigate flooding from climate change-\\nrelated disasters In addition, the government is exploring the impact of climate change on\\nMSAR’s native plant life to strengthen biodiversity protection.\\n\\nNot involved.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn terms of climate change mitigation, MSAR is exploring CCS technology, hydrogen energy\\ngeneration, offshore wind power, smart grids, improved building insulation, low-carbon\\nbuilding, urban waste recycling and reuse, and other technologies. For adaptation, as a\\nclimate-vulnerable city, MSAR’s key technological needs include recycled water utilization,\\nsea-level rise prediction, high-efficiency flood defense technology, ecosystem restoration, and\\ndisaster risk assessment methods specific to climate change impacts. Additional technical\\nrequirements are outlined in Table 6-19.\\n\\nNot involved.\\n\\nNot involved.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor capacity-building efforts, MSAR continues to focus on extreme weather early warning\\nand risk management, with ongoing regional and international cooperation in climate risk and\\ndisaster response coordination. It is essential to improve climate change coordination and\\ninformation sharing mechanisms and to enhance the skills of government officials in climate\\nresponse. Regular educational and outreach programs will raise climate awareness among\\ngovernment staff and the public, fostering broad social engagement for the accelerated\\ndevelopment of a low-carbon economy. Additional capacity-building needs are listed in Table\\n6-21.\\n\\nNot involved.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPart VI Information of MSAR on Climate Change\\n326\\n\\n\\nThe MRV work of the MSAR Government is still in its initial stages. MSAR has established\\na preliminary statistical and accounting system for its greenhouse gas inventory. Improving\\ntransparency in compliance work. First, it is necessary to continuously improve MSAR’s\\nbasic statistical and accounting systems, including statistics on energy activities, industrial\\nprocesses and product use, land use, land-use changes and forestry, and waste management,\\nclosely aligning with international compliance standards. A mechanism for routine data\\ncollection and inventory compilation is needed.

    "SYSTEM_PROMPT = \"\"\"You are a specialized analyst trained to identify and extract climate finance policy instruments from policy documents, laws, regulations, and related texts. You will receive documents in chunks and must identify qualifying instruments in each chunk. You are very discerning and very stingy about what you qualify as climate finance policy instruments. If you get it wrong, and have things in there that are not climate finance policy instruments, you will be fired. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Task\n",
    "Identify and extract policy instruments that meet ALL four criteria below:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inclusion Criteria (ALL must be met)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Public Policy Authority**\n",
    "   - Must be a formal policy: law, regulation, decree, guideline, program, financing decision, or investment decision\n",
    "   - Must originate from public authorities: national/subnational legislators, governments, central banks, regulatory agencies, enforcement agencies, or state-owned entities\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Financial Flow Focus**\n",
    "   - Must directly influence financial flows at scale (structuring, channeling, mobilizing, or redirecting)\n",
    "   - Must target the behavior of financial entities and individuals making finance-related decisions\n",
    "   - Must apply to financial actors or financial markets\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scale Requirement**\n",
    "   - Must involve financial flows \"at scale\" (not isolated, small transactions)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Explicit Climate Purpose**\n",
    "   - Must have an EXPLICIT stated purpose to materially impact:\n",
    "     - **Mitigation**: reducing GHG emissions or enhancing GHG sinks\n",
    "     - **Adaptation**: reducing vulnerability or increasing resilience to climate impacts\n",
    "     - **Loss & Damage**: compensating for climate-related losses and damages\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exclusion Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "**EXCLUDE if the policy:**\n",
    "- Lacks explicit financial flow implications (e.g., technical standards, emissions limits, vehicle quality rules, pollution disclosure) UNLESS combined with a financial mechanism (e.g., tradable permits, subsidies)\n",
    "- Only creates internal government structures (committees, advisory bodies) WITHOUT immediate financial market consequences\n",
    "- Primarily targets other environmental goals (biodiversity reserves, toxic substance bans, non-GHG air standards) even if climate co-benefits exist\n",
    "- Could theoretically affect climate finance but lacks explicit environmental/climate purpose (e.g., general consumer protection laws, generic financial advisor training requirements)\n",
    "- It is on the subnational level. If we are talking about the EU, policies in member states are acceptable. However, in any other jurisdiction, or within member states, we only want national level policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**INCLUDE if:**\n",
    "- Not climate-exclusive BUT has explicit purpose to systematically affect climate-related financial flows (e.g., ESG disclosure requirements that explicitly include climate data)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disaggregation Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "When analyzing laws, plans, or comprehensive policy documents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Split into separate instruments when:**\n",
    "   - A law contains multiple articles establishing distinct programs, funds, or incentive mechanisms\n",
    "   - Different sections create different financial mechanisms\n",
    "   - Each program/fund operates independently\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Group together when:**\n",
    "   - Multiple articles modify or detail the SAME mechanism (e.g., several clauses all describing one fund's operations)\n",
    "   - Provisions are interdependent parts of a single instrument\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ignore:**\n",
    "   - General preambles, vision statements, objectives, and targets that don't themselves create/modify a policy instrument\n",
    "   - Procedural clauses without financial implications\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Default approach:**\n",
    "   - When uncertain, err on the side of SPLITTING rather than lumping\n",
    "   - Be specific: don't name an aggregated set; identify the individual instruments\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output Format\n",
    "\n",
    "For each chunk analyzed, return a JSON array containing all identified instruments. Each instrument should be a JSON object with these fields. If you cannot identify the type or authority, those pieces can be left blank. the most important thing is to return policy names.:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "[\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    \"policy_name\": \"Specific name of the program/mechanism/instrument\",\n",
    "    \"type\": \"Type of instrument (e.g., subsidy, tax credit, grant program, loan guarantee, disclosure requirement, green bond framework)\",\n",
    "    \"authority\": \"Issuing body or agency\"\n",
    "  }\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Field Guidelines:**\n",
    "- `policy_name`: Required. Use the specific instrument name, not the parent law title\n",
    "- `type`: Optional. Leave as empty string `\"\"` if not findable\n",
    "- `authority`: Optional. Leave as empty string `\"\"` if not findable\n",
    "\n",
    "**If no qualifying instruments are found in the chunk**, return an empty array:\n",
